"CSOs impacted by the USAID freeze and the subsequent delegitimizing remarks and allegations from authorities.","Event Summary
The suspension of USAID funding has affected more than 60 civil society actors in Peru, putting at risk projects projects related to democracy, human rights, governance, the environment, and the fight against drugs. This measure has not only impacted the funding of civil society actors but has also triggered additional threats, as the government seeks to discredit civil society.
Following the suspension, President Dina Boluarte, during a speech on February 6 at the presentation ceremony of the Master&#8217;s Degree in Human Rights at CAEN, accused civil society actors of using international cooperation funds to defend criminals instead of supporting security forces. She also claimed that they were weakening security and democracy. Various organizations rejected these statements, denouncing them as an attempt to delegitimize civil society and calling for greater transparency.
Additionally, Mayor Rafael López Aliaga on February 6 during an interview on Canal N made an allegation against the NGO Manuela Ramos for misuse of USAID funds, followed by a notarised letter sent to the organisation on February 9, demanding that they retract their statements, which he claimed were false.
These attacks on civil society actors have further intensified a hostile climate for civil society in the country. This narrative not only undermines their work and restricts their participation in public policy formulation but could also lead to regulatory limitations and funding restrictions

"Journalists call for investigation on harassment denounced by journalist Clara Elvira Ospina","Event Summary
On February 11, 2025, Clara Elvira Ospina, journalist and director of the online media outlet EpicentroTv, a platform known for investigative journalism and reporting on cases of corruption and human rights violations, denounced systematic attacks and insults directed at her through social media. In her complaint, she alleged that these attacks included misogynistic and xenophobic insults, as well as unfounded accusations of terrorism—claims she attributes to unidentified state officials and politicians. This comes at a time when the use of fake social media profiles to influence public opinion about political figures and civil society actors has become widespread in Peru. Recently, the program Cuarto Poder exposed an organised digital network that actively supports the Minister of the Interior.
In response to this situation, more than a hundred journalists have signed a petition demanding that the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office investigate this case, along with other instances of harassment and cyberbullying. The State has neither responded to the allegations nor the petition.
This case highlights a concerning pattern of attacks against the independent press and civil society, further eroding trust in the State’s ability to safeguard fundamental civic freedoms.

"Fusión del Ministerio de la Mujer y Poblaciones Vulnerables-MIMP y del Ministerio de Desarrollo e Inclusión Social -MIDIS","Event Summary

Desde el 2024, se ha debatido la posible fusión entre el Ministerio de la Mujer y Poblaciones Vulnerables (MIMP) y el Ministerio de Desarrollo e Inclusión Social (MIDIS). La propuesta inicial, impulsada por el Congreso, planteaba el cambio de nombre del Ministerio de la Mujer por el Ministerio de la Familia. Sin embargo, el 28 de julio del mismo año, la presidenta Dina Boluarte anunció la intención de unificar ambos ministerios durante su mensaje a la nación.


Desde que la medida fue anunciada y hasta las primeras semanas de febrero del 2025, diversas organizaciones de la sociedad civil y ex ministros han rechazado esta decisión mediante comunicados y movilizaciones manifestando que sería un potencial retroceso a la protección y garantía de derechos de las mujeres. No obstante, el gobierno se mantiene firme en su decisión y ha confirmado la unión de ambos ministerios a través de las declaraciones del presidente del Consejo de ministros.

"Civil Society Organisations in Burundi collaborate with CENI for the 2025 Legislative Elections","Event Summary
On 12 and 13 February 2025, the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) hosted a two-day workshop with leaders of civil society organizations involved in elections at the Royal Palace Hotel in Bujumbura. This event, which included only those organizations that signed collaboration agreements with CENI for the 2025 elections, builds on previous meetings held on 17 May 2024 and 17 January 2025. The objective was to achieve a harmonized understanding of civic education, electoral education, and electoral observation through constructive dialogue. This workshop has significant implications for the enabling environment for civil society in Burundi. It demonstrates a move towards respecting and protecting fundamental civil society freedoms by fostering cooperation between the government and civil society. The event also highlights the supportive legal framework provided by Article 92 of the Constitution of Burundi and Article 4 of Decree No. 100/125 of 31 August 2018, which facilitates such engagements. However, the fact that many of CENI&#8217;s civil society partners are linked to the ruling party, while some independent organizations have been deregistered or suspended, underscores ongoing challenges. This event represents both an opportunity for enhanced cooperation and a reminder of the need for continued efforts to ensure an open and responsive state, supportive public culture, and sustainable resources for civil society actors in Burundi.

"Public discourse of stigmatization and discrediting of organizations and independent journalism in the face of the freezing of funds by USAID.","Event Summary
The recent freezing and dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has not only affected social programmes and funding for civil society actors in El Salvador but has also led to an increase in negative discourse against civil society. On 8 February 2025, the President of the Republic, Nayib Bukele, alleged that USAID funds had been misused by journalists, independent media, and other civil society actors as part of a global money laundering operation. This came a few days after he had also reportedly claimed that most of the funds were channelled to fund opposition groups, civil society organisations with political agendas, and destabilising movements. These statements are part of a broader pattern of stigmatisation and discrediting of civil society, which has also been echoed by state media.

"Recorte de recursos de USAID para la sociedad civil","Event Summary
The Executive Order, issued by US President Donald Trump on 20 January 2025, to halt US foreign development assistance to foreign countries, NGOs and international organisations, has affected the resource base for CSOs in Mexico, with an estimated 100 million USD earmarked for Mexico now frozen. Additionally, Mexican authorities have, besides downplaying the freezing of funding, discredited CSOs as funding opposition or promote hidden interests.

"USAID Funding Freeze Impact on CSOs in Indonesia","Event Summary
On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that put almost all international spending on a 90-day pause, during which all foreign aid programs will be reviewed, effectively freezing essential development aid funds. President Trump’s decision has significantly affected numerous civil society organizations in Indonesia. Many of these organizations rely on funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) with $153.5 million allocated to Indonesia in 2024. This funding freeze has halted ongoing projects, leaving CSOs in a precarious position. In response to the funding freeze, some CSOs have had to implement unpaid leave for their staff, while others are managing to pay only half of their employees’ salaries until the review process concludes. The ramifications of this aid freeze extend beyond immediate financial concerns; they also threaten the livelihoods of those working within these organizations and jeopardize critical programs in health, education, and environmental conservation.
If the freeze leads to a permanent termination of US development aid in Indonesia, this would have profound implications for the civil society sector as a whole. Numerous projects to improve public services and address societal challenges would face immediate suspension or cancellation and many CSOs would be forced to downsize or close entirely, leading to job losses for staff members and reduced services provided to vulnerable populations. USAID has played a critical role in promoting democratic governance and accountability in Indonesia. The loss of this U.S. support could hinder efforts to combat corruption, promote human rights, and engage citizens in governance processes, potentially leading to democratic backsliding.

"Continued Detention and Bail Denial of Social Media Influencer/Reality TV Personality","Event Summary
Authorities in Sierra Leone continue to detain Hawa Hunt, a social media influencer, after her bail was rescinded after failing to find two sureties with properties in Freetown&#8217;s CBD. Police arrested Hunt live on the reality TV show House of Stars on 22 December 2024, for criticising and using foul language against President Bio and First Lady Fatima Bio in a video clip from May 2023. She faces charges under the Cyber Security and Crime Act 2021, including disseminating insulting messages via a computer. Amnesty International and other rights organizations have called for her release, citing that the arrest, continued detention, and bail denial are politically motivated and among many cases where law is weaponised to supress dissent. Civil society groups have raised concerns over her physical and mental health, which is reportedly deteriorating during prolonged detention. Additionally, video recorded while in custody giving an apology is circulating online and some of her critical advocacy content has been deleted from social media platforms, revealing either self-censorship or intimidation. This has a chilling effect on the digital environment for CSOs, and freedom of speech. In the long run, it will cause to self-censorship among activists, discourage open expression and participation in public life, undermining transparency, accountability, and inclusive decision-making.

"Absolución de dirigente comunal quien fue querellado por una compañía minera por el presunto delito de difamación.","Event Summary
On 4 February 2025, the Espinar Single Criminal Court  acquitted environmental defender Sergio Huamaní of the defamation complaint filed by Antapaccay Mining Company SA. The complaint stemmed from statements Huamaní made in 2023 regarding the mining company&#8217;s impacts in Espinar, in the Cusco region, as well as corruption cases involving the multinational Glencore.
Initially, in May 2024, Huamaní was convicted of aggravated defamation and sentenced by the court of first instance to one year of suspended imprisonment and ordered to pay 10,000 soles. However, in the second instance, his sentence was overturned, with the court ruling that his statements were protected by freedom of expression.
The ruling in favor of Sergio Huamaní can serve as a legal precedent to strengthen the defense of freedom of expression and the protection of social leaders against lawsuits intended to silence them.

"New Legislation Grants Establishment, Arrest and Surveillance Authority to Foreign-Owned Private Security Companies","Event Summary
On February 18, 2025, the military regime in Myanmar announced  the enactment of the Private Security Service Law 2025, which allows foreign companies registered under the Myanmar Companies Law to apply for licenses to establish private security companies. The law grants these companies powers to arrest &#8220;offenders&#8221; in areas or buildings where they operate and hand them over to regime police. Additionally, private security companies must report any information affecting &#8220;state security&#8221; to regime police and acquire the necessary technology and equipment to carry out their security roles. The National Defense and Security Council has the power to approve the use of arms by these security companies. This new legislation passed without broad consultation and participation of civil society has sent chills across civil society, highlighting the regime&#8217;s increasing desire for control and the potential negative impacts this law will bring on public dissent and civil liberties. The law is likely to create a more hostile environment for civil society, as it empowers foreign-owned private security companies to act as extensions of the regime&#8217;s surveillance and enforcement apparatus, ready to stifle freedom of association and of expression.

"New Evidence of Corruption Among Civil Servants Exposes Paraguay's Weak Public Institutions","Event Summary
On February 3, 2025 new evidence was revealed showing the depth of corruption and organized crime infiltration in several public institutions in Paraguay. The evidence, derived from Whatsapp messages retrieved from the phone of Deputy Elulalio Gomes, who was accused of money laundering linked to drug trafficking and recently gunned down in a prosecutor-police operation, shows alleged bribery and corruption schemes involving several public servants. The evidence has since been passed on to the Public Prosecutor’s Office with the Attorney General still deciding whether to open an investigation. Meanwhile, a summit of powers, convened by President Santiago Peña, is scheduled for later this month to address these corruption issues. The alleged corruption network predominantly affects the Jury for the Trial of Magistrates, the body responsible for the trial and removal of Judges, Members of Courts, Prosecutors and Public Defenders.
The revelation provides evidence of the infiltration of organized crime in the judiciary and has triggered several sectors of the public to speak out. Dozens of CSOs have expressed their concern because &#8220;justice continues to be used as an instrument of political negotiation, and not as a pillar of guarantee for the citizenry&#8221;, which puts &#8220;at risk the physical and legal security of all Paraguayans.” Similar claims were made by the Trade Union Board; UIP, FEPRINCO, ASOBAN, industry, commerce and banking  unions;  Cardinal Adalberto Martínez; the Executives Club; and the Importers&#8217; Center, among others. The recent revelations have thus sparked a broad public demand for more transparency and accountability in the government coming not only from organized civil society but a variety of actors, including the business sector. It has placed central issues of the Rule of Law, such as legal security, separation of powers or equality before the law, on the citizens&#8217; agenda – issues which previously have not been discussed to this extent as citizens are largely disillusioned with democracy and show the highest support for autocratic forms of government in Latin America. The public debate on this constitutes a visible alert of the degradation of the justice system in Paraguay, generating a movement that seeks greater participation and a greater responsiveness of the government.

"Supreme Court rules that it is illegal to try civilians in military courts","Event Summary
On January 31, 2025, the Supreme Court of Uganda decided that military courts lack jurisdiction to try civilians, thereby effectively halting all ongoing military trials of civilians. Despite the Constitutional Court having declared military trials of civilians unconstitutional in 2021, Ugandan authorities have continued to use military courts to prosecute and arbitrarily detain civilians, particularly political opposition leaders, civil society leaders and government critics. Critics of the military trials of civilians have also faced harassment and arrests. The government has been weaponizing military courts to stifle political opposition and dissenting views. Such trials of civilians in military courts limit fundamental freedoms like the freedom of speech as civil society actors fear to be taken to jail and result in self-censorship by government critics.
The Supreme Court ruling is an important step to protect civilians from arbitrary military prosecution, thereby strengthening the protection of fundamental freedoms. By limiting military overreach, it promotes a clearer distinction between civilian and military jurisdictions, reducing the militarization of court processes for political reasons. It also sets a precedent for future cases, encouraging broader legal and institutional reforms, provides a legal basis for advocacy, and could also create a more level playing field for political actors in the upcoming elections, as opposition members and civil society actors would no longer face the threat of military trials, thereby reducing self-censorship. The decision may also enhance public trust in the judiciary and the rule of law, which could encourage greater voter participation and confidence in the electoral process.
This situation will continue to be closely monitored by the Network Member as the ruling has faced criticism from the government, which is planning to amend the Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces Act to legalize the continued trial of civilians in military courts. Should this amendment pass, more civilians will be tried, triggering fears that military trials may be used as a tactic to suppress political dissent in the upcoming electoral period.

"Chile Advances EITI Implementation: Strengthening Transparency in Extractive Governance","Event Summary
In early 2025, Chile is advancing its Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) implementation, presenting a key opportunity to institutionalise transparency and strengthen civil society participation in governance. A Multi-Stakeholder Group (GMP), which includes civil society representatives, is finalising its structure and regulatory framework to ensure transparency in the extractive sector in Chile.
While civil society participation is secured, challenges remain in enforcing transparency commitments and overcoming potential resistance from  industry stakeholders. The next phase of implementation in the coming months will be a crucial window for advocacy and oversight to ensure civil society has a formalized role in transparency discussions.
Key Opportunities:
-Institutionalise civil society’s oversight role in extractive governance
-Strengthen independent monitoring of public-private sector interactions
-Establish a model for participatory governance in other sectors
-Influence broader transparency reforms, including Law 20.500 on Citizen Participation and the National Integrity Strategy (ENIP)

"Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (HKPORI) suspends research activities following investigations and intimidations","Event Summary
Following the enactment of the repressive Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (NSL) in 2020 by China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), there has been a notable increase in the closure of critical pro-democracy groups in Hong Kong. These closures are closely associated with the weaponization of the NSL, leading to deterrence and intimidation of critical civil society. On February 13, 2025, the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (HKPORI) announced the indefinite suspension of all self-funded research activities, including long-standing tracking surveys and recent topical studies including a likely halting of all operations. The institute regularly conducted surveys on various topics including government officials&#8217; popularity, Hong Kong identity, and public attitudes towards significant events.
This decision follows multiple investigations by the National Security Department, including office searches on January 13 and subsequent questioning of the institute&#8217;s president and CEO, Robert Chung, and two staff members. HKPORI’s former deputy CEO Chung Kim-wah, currently in the UK, was added to a wanted list last December over alleged violations of NSL. Additionally, family members of exiled pro-democracy activists on the wanted list under the NSL have faced increased victimisation and harassment by national security police. On February 17, the younger aunt of former district councillor Lau Ka-man was taken in for questioning, following the detention of her other aunt and uncle on February 10. Additionally, former legislator Ted Hui disclosed that a Hong Kong court had issued a confiscation order for his family’s assets, including properties and funds held by law firms. These actions are part of a broader pattern of targeting family members of wanted individuals, which began after new bounties were announced on December 24, 2024. The Democratic Party, a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement since its founding in 1994, has also been severely impacted by increased crackdown following the implementation of the NSL, 2020. On February 20, 2025, it announced that it has started the process of disbanding. This decision came in the context of reforms in electoral system have introduced the regulation that only “patriots” can occupy positions of political power. This becomes an addition to over 90 pro-democracy organizations have also disbanded in the past year alone.
These incidents collectively illustrate the increased weaponization of the NSL in Hong Kong, leading to the silencing of pro-democracy groups. This trend severely impacts the civic space and the work of civil society, as organizations face mounting pressure and legal challenges, undermining their ability to operate freely and advocate for democratic principles.

"Arbitrary dismissal of environmental justice activist and park ranger in Bolivia","Event Summary
On December 31, 2024, park ranger Marcos Uzquiano was dismissed from his duties by the National Service of Protected Areas (Sernap) and on January 3, 2025, an administrative process was initiated against him for his work as president of the Bolivian Association of Park Rangers and Conservation Agents (Abolac), an organization that brings together all the agents that protect Bolivia&#8217;s protected areas. The dismissal, which alleges a conflict of interest between his roles as public servant and as union leader, follows previous attacks against him and his colleagues, including retaliative charges of defamation and slander filed by a cooperative miner in 2023. Despite the Obudsman’s Office filing a constitutional protection action and the constitutional court invalidating Uzquiano’s dismissal on January 13, 2025, he has not been reinstated by Sernap. His dismissal and administrative process violate his right to association and unionization. Furthermore, his work in denouncing environmental crimes has been criminalized, generating an inhibiting effect on civil society.
The case of Uzquiano highlights the use of the judicial apparatus as a tool to delegitimize and silence activists, especially in the environmental field, and underlines the structural deficiencies in the protection of human rights defenders in Bolivia. On a systemic level, this event may contribute to a change in public perception of the security and freedom of human rights defenders and may generate both domestic and international pressure for structural reforms to ensure greater protection for defenders and to strengthen the legal protection framework. If, however, Uzquiano is not immediately reinstated, this case could contribute to the normalization of the criminalization of environmental activism by creating an environment of impunity. This broader context of criminalization and lack of institutional protection creates a climate of uncertainty and intimidation, limiting the ability of defenders to act freely on behalf of their communities and the environment.

"Thailand Deports Uyghurs to China","Event Summary
On 27 February 2025, at 2:14 AM, dozens of Uyghurs who were in immigration detention centers were taken away in six trucks with windows blacked out, and flown to the Xingjiang city of Kashgar. This is the first time since 2015 that Thailand has deported Uyghurs. It demonstrates that Thailand is willing to listen to the demands of China, over the demands of civil society organisations and other countries such as the US or the EU.

On 6 March 2025, Thailand vice foreign minister Russ Jalichandra acknowledged that Bangkok had received offers from other countries to resettle the Uyghurs, reversing the previous government stance that Thailand had received no such offers. He also said that the stated proposals were “unrealistic” and would expose Thailand to retaliation from China that would impact the livelihood of many Thais. Previously, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Weychayachai said that, despite waiting for more than 10 years, no country made any concrete offers to resettle the 48 Uyghurs.
This event carries risk of arbitrary detention and torture for the 48 deported Uyghurs. In Thailand, it represents a breach of trust between the Thai government, CSOs and various foreign governments.
The fate of eight Uyghurs still believed to be in Thailand is currently unknown.

"Investigation into CSOs following allegations of funding for terrorist organisations made by U.S. Senator","Event Summary
Following the recent statement by a US Senator that USAID funds Boko-Haram in Nigeria, the Nigerian National Assembly has launched investigations into the activities of USAID and nonprofits in the country. An investigative committee set up on February 20, 2025, by the House of Representatives will focus on the activities of CSOs in the Northwestern part of the country. The investigation will be led by Hon. Victor Obuzor, Chair House Committee on CSOs. The Committee is to investigate allegations of funding for Boko Haram and other international terrorist organisations by USAID. Despite Hon. Victor Obuzor&#8217;s reassurances that he would lead the investigation with diligence, transparency, and objectivity, CSOs are concerned about the objectivity of the investigation and its implications for their work. The debates on the floor of the House of Representatives and statements by lawmakers in support of the investigation show the lack of understanding and respect for freedom of association contributing to the ongoing negative narratives about the sector while heightening threats to the sector and its workforce. CSOs also fear that new restrictive laws on CSOs work might be discussed in Parliament.
If not objectively carried out, the investigation may become part of an ongoing process of attack on civil society and push for stiffer regulations, a common trend which started in 2015 and continues until today. Over the years and in a bid to justify the need for enacting these laws that will curtail the activities of the CSOs, narratives such as “NGOs are conduits for money laundering and terrorism financing” have grown but with no evidence. The funding freeze by the US government and ongoing dis/misinformation related to it has increased the pressure on the civil society sector, including renewed attacks. The growing narrative that NGOs in the country support terrorism, spread by government and other actors even before, has now found a home amidst the attacks on USAID and its operations both by US decision-makers, security agencies in the country and a section of the public. If not properly handled, the investigation and the related narratives being spread can lead to the passage of additional, restrictive laws and further decrease public trust in the work of civil society.

"President Hichilema's Call for Respect of Due Process and for the Promotion of Online Professionalism","Event Summary
On 5th March 2025, during the swearing-in ceremony of Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) Director General Daphne Chabu and Human Rights Commission (HRC) Director General Mbololwa Wamunyima, President Hakainde Hichilema emphasized his commitment to fostering due process and online professionalism. He dismissed claims that he is restricting the operations of Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) and reaffirmed his dedication to ensuring thorough investigations before arrests are made. This approach aims to prevent unnecessary detentions without bond or bail when applicable, aligning with principles of due process and human rights. President Hichilema&#8217;s stance marks a significant departure from past practices, where arbitrary arrests and prolonged pretrial detentions were prevalent, as detailed in the previous human rights reports and the 2017 arrest of Hichilema himself on charges of treason. This shift can signal a positive development for civil society, fostering an environment where citizens can trust that law enforcement agencies operate fairly and justly, if it is indeed applied by law enforcement agencies.

Furthermore, President Hichilema called for professionalism in cyberspace, stressing that it is currently being misused. He called on the Human Rights Commission to take an active role in promoting responsible online behaviour. This emphasis on online professionalism is a commendable initiative that can significantly enhance the enabling environment for civil society in Zambia, encouraging constructive dialogue and reducing harmful behaviours like misinformation and cyberbullying. Currently, Zambia lacks specific legislation defining &#8220;online professionalism&#8221; for civil society and activists, leading to uncertainty and potentially hindering advocacy efforts. Without clear guidelines, activists may fear repercussions, leading to self-censorship and a diminished capacity to hold authorities accountable.

"Amendments to cybercrimes act restrict free speech online","Event Summary
On 23 January 2025, the Pakistan parliament amended the 2016 cybercrimes law, known as the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA). The PECA Amendment Act 2025 created a new penal offense of intentional distribution and sharing of false information, with a penalty of up to three years in jail and fines of up to 2 million Pakistani Rupees. The amendment also provides for new types of online content that are prohibited and or blocked including false information and defamatory content especially in relation to representatives of the executive, judiciary, legislature and the armed forces. The Act establishes a number of new government agencies and tribunals to enforce content blocking and prosecute criminal cases and was passed without any serious consultation with relevant stakeholders.
The PECA Amendment Act 2025 equips the government with the wide-reaching powers to control online content and, in the process, violates the freedom of speech, press freedom, and digital rights. The lack of clarity in the laws and the possibility of their arbitrary application conflict with the principles of proportionality and necessity that are part of international human rights law. Additionally, the penalties provided for by the law have provoked fear and self-censorship among various participants, thus going against democratic principles and the basic right to free speech. Civil society and journalist and media organizations have expressed concern that the law may be misused to silence dissent, which will in turn lead to less investigative journalism and a denial of the right of the public to know.
The implementation of the PECA Amendment Act 2025 is part of a general trend of laws that have progressively taken away civil rights to free speech and freedom of expression over the last year. This trend includes significant actions such as the ban on Twitter (now X) during the February 2024 general elections, which continues until today. The amendment also coincides with the restriction of internet freedoms in the country, with the government admitting to using a ‘web management system’ with deep packet inspection for surveillance and frequent reports of the government throttling Internet access to stifle political activism.
The amendment also coincides with the restriction of internet freedoms in the country in 2024, with the government admitting to using a ‘web management system’ with deep packet inspection for surveillance, the continued domestic ban on the X network (previously Twitter), and frequent reports of the government throttling Internet access to stifle political activism.
The PFUJ, the country’s biggest journalist union has gone to court over the PECA amendment and has called for a countrywide protest. Newspaper editors and publishers and TV news channel owners have also come up with a united front against the development. Other legal challenges to the constitutionality of the PECA amendment have been filed in other courts. Lawyers say the amendment is inconsistent with Article 19 of Pakistan’s constitution, which allows for freedom of speech, within reasonable limits.

"Lawmakers continue to push for regulation to enforce “anti-NGO” law, support the suspension of USAID funding","Event Summary
Lawmakers in Paraguay continue to push for the enforcement of the ‘Law Establishing Control, Transparency and Accountability for Non-Profit Organizations,’ calling out delays in the passing of secondary regulation necessary for its operationalization. The Law (Law No. 7363) which was passed in November 2024 has been rejected by various sectors of Paraguayan society for establishing serious restrictions on the rights of civil society organizations. Once implemented, the law is expected to limit freedom of association by, among other restrictions, placing excessive administrative burden on civil society organizations, thereby making cooperation channels more difficult, forcing smaller organizations to close down, and preventing new ones from being opened.
The push for enforcement of the law, dubbed ‘anti-NGO law’ by civil society actors, is part of a broader campaign against NGOs in Congress, which previously established a Bicameral Commission of Inquiry (CBI) investigating allegations of money laundering through NGOs. While the CBI already had a negative impact on the enabling environment, discrediting civil society organizations and violating their right to privacy, members have now announced that they will request documents from USAID to further investigate the organizations funded by them. The discourse surrounding the USAID funding freeze, particularly the allegations of misuse of resources by civil society and of foreign interference in national political affairs, thus adds to anti-NGO narratives used to justify the CBI investigation as well as the push for Law 7363. As part of these narratives, Paraguayan lawmakers have supported the freezing of USAID funding, which had seriously disrupted civil society work in Paraguay, as a push for increased transparency. The Vice-Presidency of the Foreign Relations Commission further announced the participation of  a Senator of the ruling party in the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in May 2025 in Hungary, to give a presentation on the &#8220;cultural battle against NGOs&#8221; in Paraguay, further providing evidence of the government’s political agenda against civil society.

"Congress approves amendment to the Law of the Peruvian Agency for International Cooperation (APCI), threatening the autonomy and sustainability of CSOs","Event Summary
On 12 March 2025, Congress passed a series of restrictive measures targeting civil society organizations by amending the Law Establishing the Peruvian Agency for International Cooperation (APCI). These reforms expand government control and interference in civil associations, marking a significant shift toward a more restrictive environment that undermines their autonomy and independence.
Under the new law, APCI will require all civil society organizations receiving international cooperation funding to register and comply with a set of arbitrary regulations and disproportionate sanctions, threatening their long-term sustainability.
Despite strong opposition from civil society, the law was rushed through in a first vote without the possibility of a second debate. It now awaits either enactment or veto by the executive branch; otherwise, Congress may proceed with its promulgation.

"Prosecutor warns environmental leaders opposing the Tia Maria mining project to avoid actions that could disturb public order","Event Summary
On 17 February 2025, community leaders, environmental defenders, farmers, and residents of the Tambo Valley in Arequipa began peaceful protests against the Tía María and La Tapada mining project by Southern Copper Corporation, which has government approval.
That same day, several defenders received preventive warnings from the Islay Provincial Criminal Prosecutor’s Office, urging them to avoid actions that could disturb public order or pose risks to public safety. While this measure is not a formal complaint or investigation, civil society actors argue that it threatens activists and seeks to restrict the right to protest and criminalise social movements. If misused, it could lead to significant deterioration in the enabling environment for environmental activists and defenders.

"Draft NGO Law reinforces political oversight on NGOs","Event Summary
The recent USAID funding freeze has re-ignited discussions of the NGO Bill by the government, which was initially drafted in January 2024 without a comprehensive consultative process with the sector. The draft law titled Non-Governmental Organizations (Registration and Supervision) Act will repeal and replace the Voluntary Social Service Organisations (Registration and Supervision) Act No. 31 of 1980 (VSSO Act). Civil society has raised several concerns in relation to the proposed legislation as it aims primarily at regulating them and not supporting them, and as it contains vague and subjective restrictions on NGO activities. It has been warned that the law could be interpreted to &#8220;restrict dissent, alternate political views and activities perceived as opposing government.”
In addition, the political party Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna has called for the appointment of a parliamentary select committee to investigate both registered and unregistered non-governmental organisations operating in the country.

"Civil society report revealing electoral fraud is met with retaliation","Event Summary
In response to the publication of its report “The War Against Voters” in February 2025, the Pattan Development Organisation has faced retaliatory attacks by the government of Pakistan. The detailed report alleges extensive electoral fraud in Pakistan’s 2024 general elections, identifying 64 distinct methods of manipulation, including significant discrepancies in voter turnout and alterations to election result forms published on the Election Commission’s website. The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) dismissed the findings, labeling the report as “baseless and fabricated propaganda.”
Following the report’s release, authorities sealed the residence of Pattan’s National Coordinator, Sarwar Bari, in Islamabad, and the organization’s office in Multan, actions perceived as retaliation for exposing alleged electoral misconduct and as an attempt to suppress independent voices and civil society activism. This action seems to be a part of the existing trend of enhancing restrictions on civil society and the suppression of dissenting voices in Pakistan. This pattern suggests a shrinking civic space in which civil society organizations and independent monitors are facing growing challenges in making authorities accountable and encouraging democratic transparency in Pakistan. This precedent of retaliation for a report that seeks to expose corruption or lack of transparency has the potential to intimidate CSOs and may mean that other organizations are less likely to follow Pattan’s example and carry out their own independent monitoring or criticize electoral processes. The right to access to information is also affected negatively, as discredited or suppressed civil society reports limit the public’s access to information on the integrity of elections. Additionally, the ECP’s reaction to dismiss the report and react punitively, rather than investigating these claims through transparent processes, shows that it is reluctant to ensure transparency, which can discourage people from coming out to vote in future elections and erodes people’s confidence in elections.

"The continued use of Prevention of Terrorism Act and its implications","Event Summary
On 28 February 2025, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and founding leader of the National People’s Power party announced plans to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and introduce new legislation. The PTA, enacted in 1979 and made permanent in 1982, has been widely criticised for enabling prolonged detentions without charge and violating human rights. 
Ahead of the 2024 elections, the ruling National People’s Power (NPP) pledged to abolish the PTA. However, the government’s continued use of Detention Orders under the PTA has cast doubt on this promise. There is scepticism that the replacement law may retain the PTA’s repressive elements.

"Impact of USAID and US foreign ministry funding freezing in Cambodia","Event Summary
CCC conducted an online survey with its members about funding freezing from USAID and the US foreign department. Based on the survey, 62% of respondents answered that staff is the main issue they are facing. Results indicate that financial constraints have significantly impacted organizations, leading to staff layoffs, salary reductions, and the suspension of key operations. Many organizations have reduced or completely halted funding for projects, affecting aid to children, people with disabilities, NGOs, and community-based organizations (CBOs). Some have shifted to remote work as a cost-saving measure, while others have stopped activities entirely. Staff wellbeing has also been affected due to increased workloads and the loss of incentives. Additionally, long decision-making processes, influenced by the shift of authority from local offices to regional or headquarters, have caused further delays. Several organizations have responded by reducing operational costs, furloughing project-related experts, and cutting salaries by 30-45% for key staff during a 90-day suspension period. The overall impact has resulted in widespread job losses, project cancellations, and uncertainty in service delivery. For further information, please see the report attached.

"Protest in Tambogrande against the El Algarrobo mining project result in injuries and arrests following clashes with police","Event Summary
On February 28, residents of Tambogrande in Peru’s Piura region staged a protest against the El Algarrobo mining project promoted by Buenaventura Buenaventura Mining Company, which they claim threatens natural resources, community life and territorial sovereignty.
The police responded by using excessive force to clear the Sullana-Tambogrande highway, resulting in clashes with protesters. As a result, several community members and activists were injured, and at least five were arrested. According to reports, some detainees faced mistreatment, were denied access to lawyers, and were coerced into signing statements.

"Proposed amendment to the Criminal Code is not supported","Event Summary
On 27 December 2024, Members of Parliament—Ch. Lodoisambuu, B. Bayarbaatar, D. Enkhtuya, and A. Ganbaatar—submitted a draft amendment to repeal Section 1 of Article 13.14 from the Criminal Code. Article 13.14 of the Criminal Code, enacted in 2020, which criminalises “spreading false information that harms one’s reputation”. Lawmakers have pointed out that the terminology and conceptual framework remain ambiguous, making its application problematic. After the draft was submitted to the Chairman of the State Great Khural, it will now follow the legislative procedure. Removing Article 13.14 from the Criminal Code would not only protect freedom of expression but also create a more open environment for journalists and civil society organisations to operate without fear of criminal prosecution.
However, upon contact with the Legal Department of the Parliament Secretariat, it was communicated that the draft law had been reviewed by the Standing Committee on State Structure and was denied, i.e. not supported. This means that the draft will not be discussed.

"Anti-LGBTIQ+ Statements by Congresswoman Milagros Jáuregui generate reactions and protests in front of the Congress","Event Summary
On 27 February 2025, Congresswoman Milagros Jáuregui de Aguayo, president of the Congressional Women and Family Commission, made statements about the LGBTIQ + community during a congressional event. The legislator questioned same-sex relationships, describing them as lacking “true love” and motivated by “lust and lasciviousness.” She also stated that gender ideology is a “cultural fight,” asserting that human beings should not be allowed to act “like animals,” referring to the LGBTIQ+ community .
Her statements generated immediate reactions. On February 28, the Promsex organization issued a statement rejecting their claims and stating that they lack legal or scientific support. It also demanded that authorities stop disseminating messages that violate people&#8217;s dignity. Likewise, various organizations, such as the LGBTI Observatory, the Peruvian LGBTI Network, and Marcha del Orgullo, with the support of Congresswoman Susel Paredes, called for a sit-in in front of Congress on March 3. The demonstration ended in clashes with the police , with allegations of repression against members of the LGBTIQ+ community.
Later, at a press conference, activists rejected Jáuregui&#8217;s statements. Furthermore, Susel Paredes filed a constitutional complaint against her, arguing that his comments violate the Constitution and foster intolerance and hatred toward the LGBTIQ+ community.

"Release of Detained Government Critic Amidst Advocacy Pressure Exposes Vulnerability of Activists in Sierra Leone","Event Summary
Authorities in Sierra Leone released Hawa Hunt, a social media influencer, after nearly three months of arbitrary detention for criticising President Bio and First Lady Fatima Bio. Her release on March 4, 2025, followed pressure from international media, rights groups like Amnesty International, her family, and local CSOs including Lawyers Society and Legal Link, who represented her in her court cases. The case drew significant attention, leading to the resignation of David Pratt, a long-time Honorary Canadian Consul to Sierra Leone, in protest of her detention and ill-treatment.
The case was discharged on 4 March 2025 by Appeal Court Judge Tonia Barnett after the prosecution withdrew all charges, without explanation. This decision came shortly after First Lady Fatima Bio publicly requested Hawa&#8217;s release in a recorded video. The incident has raised concerns about the independence of the judiciary and whether the influence of high-ranking officials outweighs the due process of law. Hawa Hunt has not been acquitted of the charges, they have just been withdrawn without explanation. The Cyber Security and Crime Act, 2021 and the Public Order Act, 1965 to target government critics can still be enforced against her or others.

"Freezing of Funding to Radio Free Asia and Voice of America by the U.S. Administration","Event Summary
On March 15, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order to suspend funding for several broadcasting institutions including Voice of America (VOA), Radio Free Asia (RFA), and Radio Free Europe (RFE). Hundreds of employees received emails stating they were prohibited from entering offices and must surrender their press credentials and office equipment. The White House described this action as ensuring &#8220;taxpayers no longer pay for radical propaganda.&#8221; This decision follows a 30-day funding freeze announced earlier this month by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk. The leadership of these organizations has expressed intentions to challenge this decision. This suspension of funding significantly restricts the civic space by limiting access to diverse information sources and curtailing press freedom.

"Detention and judicial harassment of human rights defender and community leaders","Event Summary
On 25 February 2025, police and the Attorney General&#8217;s Office in El Salvador cracked down on human rights defenders and residents of Hacienda La Floresta, San Juan Opico, who were resisting the eviction of families.  During the operation, the non governmental organisation UNIDEHC had its headquarters raided and its spokesperson Fidel Zavala was arbitrarily detained &#8211; together with more than 20 community leaders. Recently, UNIDEHC and Zavala were involved in the defense of Hacienda La Floresta community, filling several actions before public authorities for arbitrary detentions of community leaders.
The defenders and community leaders were accused as alleged members of a network of scammers who traded lands, and are currently detained awaiting trials.
On 13–14 March 2025, a court specialising in organised crime ordered preventive detention for 25 residents, including Fidel Zavala. Prosecutors accused UNIDEHC of being a &#8220;front NGO&#8221; and charged the defendants with illicit association and irregular land sales. The residents claim they had lived there for 12 years and sought legal recognition of their property rights. On 18 March 2025, additional UNIDEHC spokespersons, Ivania Cruz and Rudy Joya, faced similar charges. 
Zavala is also facing two other criminal cases. On 17 March, a retrial began for a fraud case in which he was previously acquitted, and on 14 March 2025, he was notified of a third fraud-related prosecution.

"Former Move Forward Party MPs summoned by Anti-Corruption Commission / Khanun’s Hunger Strike","Event Summary

On 7 August 2024, pursuant to a petition from the Election Commission of Thailand, the Constitutional Court ruled to dissolve the Move Forward Party (MFP). The ruling found that proposing amendments to the royal defamation law is treasonous, and the MFP was dissolved. A complaint was filed against the 44 current and former MPs with the party for submitting a bill to parliament to propose amendment to the lèse-majesté law. Some of the MPs received letters summoning them to meet the investigation committee on February 14th. If the MPs are found guilty, they can be banned for life from running for election. 
Activist and prisoner Khanun Sirapop began a hunger strike on 21 February 2025 to protest his denial of bail. He was sentenced to 2 years in prison by the Bangkok South Criminal Court for speaking at a rally on 18 November 2020.

"Disbandment of Renowned Local Advocacy Group Hong Kong Unison","Event Summary
On 28 February 2025, the Hong Kong Unison (融樂會) announced its decision to dissolve after 24 years of advocating for the rights of ethnic minorities. The association held a special members’ meeting where the resolution was passed, with Chairperson Chong Ming-lian stating that the organization had completed its historical mission. The dissolution process will involve the appointment of two liquidators, with assets amounting to approximately HK$4 million being used to cover severance and long-service payments, with the remainder to be donated to similar organizations.
The dissolution removes an advocate for minority rights and democratic values and highlights the difficulty of sustaining civil society activism in an environment that increasingly limits space for public advocacy and dissent.

"League of Social Democrats Cancels Protest Action Citing ""Strong Pressure""","Event Summary
On 26 February 2025, the Hong Kong League of Social Democrats (LSD) announced the cancellation of its planned protest outside the Government Headquarters. The petition was initially intended to protest the 2025 Budget announcement and the government’s fiscal policies. However, in a statement released the night before the scheduled action, the LSD cited “strong pressure” as the reason for withdrawing the action. The protest had called for a series of demands, including halting major infrastructure projects, reducing the pay of government officials and lawmakers, and releasing political prisoners. The cancellation marks a notable moment in the ongoing political climate, where the few remaining political parties in Hong Kong are feeling significant pressure to curtail their public opposition.

"Hong Kong Journalists Association Faces Venue Denials Amid Escalating Restriction of Association Rights","Event Summary
On 19 February 2025, the Eaton Hotel in the Jordan area abruptly cancelled the Hong Kong Journalists Association’s (HKJA) annual spring dinner scheduled for February 24, without explanation. This followed the Regal Hong Kong Hotel’s cancellation on February 13, citing dubious reasons like water leakage and power supply issues, despite hosting other events. These cancellations, likely due to external pressure, disrupted a key fundraising event with attendees including legislators, foreign consuls, and business representatives. According to the chairwoman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, these cancellations appear to be coordinated efforts to restrict their activities and are part of a pattern. In January 2025 already, the HKJA Cup football tournament faced cancellations from both the Jockey Club Kitchee Centre and the Happy Valley Recreation Ground. These actions signal a closing space for independent journalism associations in Hong Kong, threatening their ability to maintain professional networks and conduct necessary fundraising. The implications are severe: freedom of assembly and press are under threat, and the sustainability of independent professional bodies is at risk. This trend creates a chilling effect on civil society, demonstrating the vulnerability of professional organizations to indirect pressure and signalling a shift in the relationship between commercial entities and civil society groups.

"Social Worker Jackie Chen Convicted of Rioting; Faces Professional Disqualification","Event Summary
On 12 March 2025, social worker Jackie Chen Hung-sau (陳虹秀), 48, was convicted of rioting in the District Court in Wan Chai, in a retrial related to her involvement in an anti-government protest on 31 August 2019. Deputy District Judge May Chung Ming-sun remanded her in custody with sentencing scheduled for April 9. The case is significant as it comes after Chen was previously acquitted in September 2020, but the Court of Appeal later ordered a retrial. Following the conviction, on 12 March 2025, Labor and Welfare Bureau Chief Sun Yuhan stated that the Social Workers Registration Board would handle Chen&#8217;s license renewal application according to the Social Workers Registration Ordinance, which specifies procedures for cases involving criminal convictions. Last year, legislation was passed to allow the Social Workers Registration Board to disqualify social workers convicted of national security offenses or other crimes that could bring the profession &#8220;into disrepute&#8221;. The Board responded on March 13 that they have not yet reviewed her renewal application as the court has not yet issued a sentence.

"Punitive Legal Costs and Harsh Sentences on Ma Chun-man's case used to Intimidate and Suppress Dissent in Hong Kong","Event Summary
On 4 March 2025, the Hong Kong Correctional Services Department (CSD) succeeded in petitioning the court to impose half of the legal costs regarding the judicial review of a decision on activist Ma Chun-man by amending a previous court ruling that had dismissed the case without costs. Ma had sought judicial review challenging the Correctional Services Department’s decision refusing to reduce his sentence under the National Security Law (NSL) based on the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) (also known as Article 23), a law passed long after his imprisonment. The ordinance requires that for prisoners convicted of offenses endangering national security to obtain remission of sentence or early release, the Commissioner of Correctional Services must first determine whether such remission or early release &#8220;will not be contrary to the interests of national security.&#8221; If it is contrary, such early release or remission &#8220;must not&#8221; be granted. Initially, the court dismissed Ma’s review without issuing a costs order. The CSD then petitioned the court to modify its decision, resulting in Ma being required to pay half the legal costs of the review and the full cost of the application to modify the costs order. This financial burden is an obstacle for individuals seeking to challenge government actions, particularly in cases involving national security laws. This reflects a growing trend since the NSL&#8217;s enactment in 2020, where the Hong Kong government increasingly uses mechanisms to suppress dissent and restrict challenges to state actions.

"Statements by President Boluarte and the Ministry of Women Undermine Press Freedom","Event Summary
On 3 March 2025, President Dina Boluarte  accused América Televisión and Canal N of collaborating with prosecutors to undermine her government and alleged that the media was promoting a coup. The president defended Interior Minister Juan José Santiváñez after the Attorney General&#8217;s Office raided his home in an investigation into abuse of authority. The controversy intensified after the minister revealed in an interview that he had access to the content of a news report prior to its broadcast. Minister Santiváñez&#8217;s statements, admitting that he had early access to a journalistic investigation implicating him in corruption, are part of this pattern of attacks on press freedom and a lack of transparency in public administration. Furthermore, President Boluarte&#8217;s response, calling the press &#8220;coup-mongering&#8221; and accusing it of conspiring with the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, reinforces the government&#8217;s tendency to delegitimize the oversight role of the media and judicial institutions.





Journalist groups, including the  National Association of Journalists  (ANP) and the  Institute of Press and Society  (IPYS), condemned Boluarte&#8217;s accusations, stressing the importance of press freedom. Journalist Gustavo Gorriti also criticized the president&#8217;s statements and hinted at a possible raid on his home.
In response, the  Ministry of Women issued a statement warning against the press stating that such rhetoric fosters aggression and intolerance towards women, cautioning that such discourse should not be justified under freedom of expression.

The Peruvian Ministry of Culture initially approved the play María Maricón for performances on 30–31 January 2025 at the PUCP Cultural Center, but later revoked its authorisation, citing non-compliance with Law 30870, which requires cultural content to align with community traditions. This led to the festival&#8217;s cancellation . The mayor of Lima and several congress members opposed the play, claiming it was anti-Catholic, while others criticised the decision as a threat to freedom of expression.
Separately, on 27 February, the Ministry accused the Arequipa-based bookstore Fabla Salvaje of unauthorised use of its logo, threatening legal action for alleged falsification. The bookstore, a beneficiary of ministry funding, denounced this as part of a pattern of disproportionate measures aimed at restricting free expression. The accusation coincided with the launch of the book State Violence in Peru , prompting concerns about political motives behind the Ministry&#8217;s actions.

"Sierra Leone Police Arrest Dutch Journalist and Aide Amid Media Freedom Concerns","Event Summary
On 13 February 2025, the Sierra Leone Police arrested and detained Dutch journalist Sophie Van Leeuwen, an Africa correspondent for RTL Nieuws, accusing her of unlawfully capturing images and espionage. She was investigating fugitive drug lord Jos Leijdekker, who was reported to be hiding in Sierra Leone and was seen attending a local ceremony with the first family. RTL Nieuws&#8217; editor-in-chief, Ilse Oppeneer, revealed that Sophie was accredited by the Ministry of Information and Civic Education (MoICE) in Sierra Leone. Her aide, Joseph Turay, the Managing Editor for Public Review Newspaper, was also arrested with her. Both were taken to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID), where Joseph reportedly escaped and fled the country. Sophie was interrogated for over 15 hours on suspicion of espionage. After several days, she was released, but the police confiscated her memory card and deleted some video files from her laptop.
This incident underscores the risks faced by journalists in Sierra Leone, where investigative reporting on sensitive issues can lead to arrest, detention, and forced deletion of work. Such actions create a hostile environment for civil society, deterring journalists and activists from pursuing critical investigations and reporting on matters of public interest.

"Revision of the Indonesian National Armed Forces Law presents serious threat to civil society and democracy","Event Summary
On 20 March 2025, the Indonesian House of Representatives (DPR) has approved the revision of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) Law. Passed in a rushed process, without notification or granting the public access to the draft law, the revision has the potential to lead Indonesia towards a militaristic regime reminiscent of the Orde Baru (New Order) era, the regime of former President Soeharto. Activists who have spoken out against the revision of the bill have faced intimidation and criminalization.
The revised law expands the authority of the military to other areas than war, allows additional civilian positions to be filled by active TNI members, and extends the military service’s retirement age. It therefore enables military overreach into civilian government domains, impacting systems, structures, and other aspects related to state affairs and citizenship more broadly. This could result in the narrowing of civil space and democracy, as well as an increase in human rights violations committed by the military. The 32 years of authoritarianism and militarism under the Orde Baru regime indicate four main concerns with the expansion of military authority: the erosion of civilian supremacy, institutional changes, human rights concerns, and decreasing public trust and civic space.
The revision of the TNI Law is thus not merely a legislative change, it represents a potential turning point for Indonesia’s democracy. The systemic and structural implications of this event could lead to a significant shift in how governance is conducted, with far-reaching consequences for civil liberties, human rights, and the overall health of Indonesian democracy. As such, it is crucial for civil society, policymakers, and international observers to remain vigilant and advocate for accountability and transparency in governance moving forward.

"Conviction of Former Members of Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China Overturned","Event Summary
On 6 March 2025, in a rare and significant legal victory, three core members of the now-disbanded HK Alliance, including former vice-chairperson Chow Hang-tung, had their convictions overturned by the Court of Final Appeal. The trio had been convicted under the National Security Law for refusing to comply with police orders to submit organizational documents in 2021. This marked the first time that a case under the National Security Law (NSL) is successful on appeal. The court ruled that the prosecution’s actions had deprived the defendants of a fair trial, ultimately leading to the reversal of their convictions. This ruling is notable, given the low rate of successful appeals in NSL-related cases, highlighting the challenges to securing justice in such politically sensitive cases.

"Sedition Conviction of Pro-Democracy Activist Confimed: No Need to Prove Intent to Incite Violence","Event Summary
On March 6, 2025, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal delivered a significant judgment in the sedition case of pro-democracy activist Tam Tak-chi (commonly known as “Fast Beat”), former vice-chairman of the Hong Kong People Power. The court unanimously dismissed Tam&#8217;s appeal, upholding his conviction on 11 charges, including sedition, related to his 2020 street protests. The key point of the ruling was the court&#8217;s clarification that under Hong Kong&#8217;s legal framework, the prosecution does not need to prove intent to incite violence or disturb public order in sedition cases. This judgment solidified the interpretation of sedition offenses under the Hong Kong National Security Law and clarified that sedition cases could be tried in district courts rather than requiring a jury trial in the High Court. The ruling has significant implications for the future of sedition prosecutions and political speech in Hong Kong, as it makes it easier for civil society actors to be jailed, restricts freedom of expression, increases self-censorship, and undermines public trust in the judicial system.

"Structural reduction of Dutch spending on international development expected to negatively affect Indonesian CSOs","Event Summary
On February 20, 2025, the Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development presented a policy letter to the House of Representatives outlining a new approach to international development. The government announced a structural reduction in international development spending by €2.4 billion starting in 2027, reducing the budget from 0.62% of gross national income (GNI) in 2024 to 0.44% by 2029. This shift reflects a strategic focus on aligning international development efforts with Dutch interests, prioritizing trade and economic growth, security and stability, and migration management. The policy emphasizes leveraging Dutch expertise in areas like water management, food security, and health while narrowing efforts to a limited number of countries, mainly near Europe.
Key changes include phasing out projects related to gender equality, education, sports, and culture while scaling down climate and civil society initiatives. However, humanitarian aid will remain a cornerstone of Dutch foreign policy. The government aims to foster partnerships that mutually benefit the Netherlands and recipient countries by enhancing trade links, supporting local businesses, and addressing global challenges like migration and instability.
The Dutch policy shift has implications for Indonesia&#8217;s CSO&#8217;s enabling environment in terms of accessible and sustainable resources. It will reduce funding for CSOs focusing on gender equality, education, climate action, or cultural projects that face funding cuts as these areas are deprioritized. This jeopardizes ongoing programs and limits their ability to address critical local issues. Furthermore, reduced funding for civil society initiatives could, in the long term, weaken CSOs’ ability to advocate for marginalized communities or address systemic issues like gender inequality or climate change.
Dutch&#8217;s policy shift represents a structural transformation that could reshape how international aid operates in Indonesia, affecting both civil society capacity and broader development outcomes. The €2.4 billion reduction in Dutch international development spending will structurally limit resources available for Indonesian CSOs. Moreover, by tying aid to trade and economic goals, the policy redefines development cooperation into a transactional model that prioritizes donor benefits over recipient needs. In addition, as a prominent donor country, the Netherlands’ policy shift may influence other nations to adopt similar approaches, further constraining resources for Indonesian CSOs.

"Dismantling of Transparency Agency Undermines Access to Information","Event Summary
On 20 March 2025, amendments to Mexico’s General Law on Transparency and Access to Public Information were published, threatening civil society’s ability to monitor government actions, report corruption, and hold authorities accountable. The reform follows an earlier initiative by President Claudia Sheinbaum to dissolve the National Institute for Transparency, Access to Information, and Personal Data Protection (INAI) and replace it with “Transparency for the People,” a body under direct government control. The dissolution of the independent oversight institution creates conflicts of interest by placing transparency mechanisms under the control of the executive branch. Without an impartial body to guarantee access to information, people must resort to the courts to challenge decisions, making transparency more difficult and costly to uphold.
Civil society organizations also express concern over other provisions, such as the increased number of grounds for classifying information as confidential. Vague criteria, including terms like &#8220;social peace&#8221; and &#8220;damage to the state&#8217;s interest,&#8221; grant authorities broad discretion to restrict access to critical information. This development is part of a broader trend of weakening autonomous institutions in Mexico, consolidating power within the executive and weakening a key check on governmental authority.

"Precarious Sustainability of Malaysian CSOs Following US Foreign Aid Freeze","Event Summary
The human rights organisation Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM) has been significantly impacted by the 90-day freeze on foreign aid initiated by an executive order from President Trump on 20 January 2025. This funding freeze immediately halted half of SUARAM’s ongoing programmes under two funders, as well as use of more than half of core funding for operations. International NGOs of which SUARAM is a member —OMCT, FIDH, and FORUM-ASIA—also experienced funding reductions, limiting potential collaborations, and shortening timelines for ongoing projects such as the biannual report with FORUM-ASIA on national human rights institutions. Based on SUARAM’s current financial situation, the organisation’s reserves can sustain operations up until the end of 2025, prompting active efforts to secure alternative funding.  
Beyond SUARAM, the foreign aid freeze has disrupted a wide spectrum of Malaysian CSOs, including those working on institutional reform, refugee and migrant rights, LGBTIQ+ rights, mental health for marginalised groups, diversity &amp; inclusion, environmental conservation and climate change. The freeze has forced many NGOs to scale back operations, cancel programmes that are either ongoing or about to commence, reduce salaries or retrench staff. The ripple effects extend to coalition spaces in which SUARAM convenes or participates, such as the Police Accountability Cluster and the Freedom of Expression Cluster, where CSO members representing diverse sectors collaborate for advocacy and public education to address issues related to police accountability and freedom of expression respectively. With multiple coalition members affected by the freeze, and core coalition funding suspended, these platforms have had to drastically reduce activity — limiting cross-sector coordination, weakening collective advocacy, and constraining the capacity of CSOs that typically lead or drive the planning and implementation of coalition efforts.

"Citizens exercise their right to protest, calling for greater civic participation and responsiveness in public administration","Event Summary
In the last days of March 2025, massive and peaceful demonstrations took place in Paraguay, mainly in the capital, Asunción. Various sectors of society — workers from public and private entities, university students, retirees, people with disabilities, the elderly, and even the migrant population — exercised their constitutional right to protest. On Tuesday 25 March 2025, dozens of social organizations gathered in the historic center, calling for an end to corruption, an end to impunity in the justice system, and demanding improvements in fundamental areas such as work, education and health. On Wednesday 26 March 2025, under the slogan “United for Paraguay”, sectors of the opposition demonstrated against mafia-like structures in the state; and on Wednesday 27 March 2025, the farmers staged their traditional annual march (the 31st), with the slogan “For the land, production and against all injustices”. In the days leading up to the event, human rights organizations and the media reiterated the constitutional guarantees on the freedom to demonstrate. 
Despite some allegations of attempts to intimidate leaders, the demonstrations took place as planned and, at the end of the farmers&#8217; march, the National Police reported that the day had passed without incidents and with good inter-institutional cooperation. This event highlights the strengthening of the exercise of the right to protest, while at the same time demonstrating challenges for the State to respond effectively to growing citizen demands. This alert highlights positive progress in the exercise of fundamental rights, while at the same time pointing to the need to improve dialogue and the government&#8217;s response to citizen dissatisfaction.

"Military Regime withholds certificates of around 800 doctors after blacklisting them","Event Summary
The military regime has blacklisted and withheld the degree certificates of approximately 800 doctors who were set to receive certification in 2025, preventing them from practicing. This has been a growing trend targeting healthcare workers associated with the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) — a peaceful protest led by civil servants against the military coup that brought the regime to power. Those affected began medical school in 2018, prior to the junta&#8217;s coup in February 2021. The junta has also barred them from applying for passports or traveling abroad. The refusal to issue certificates appears to be in retaliation for the doctors’ refusal to return to government jobs to complete their residencies after the failed coup. Although the doctors signed an agreement to serve as government employees for three years after completing their studies, those who failed to fulfil this commitment were required to pay a fine of MMK 1 million (around USD 650 at that time). However, the junta has also refused to issue certificates to those who had paid the fines. 
On 10 March 2025, the junta announced the arrest of 7 people, including three foreign ministry officials, involved in the facilitation of notary services for a student with a certificate from the Interim University Council of the University of Medicine (Mandalay) who applied to study abroad. The National Unity Government (NUG) is an exiled government formed by elected lawmakers and MPs who were ousted following the 2021 coup and the Interim University Council of the University of Medicine (Mandalay) is an NUG-affiliated institution.

"Activist Khanun Sirapop on Hunger Strike Amid Ongoing Detention","Event Summary
Khanun Sirapop, a political activist in Thailand, went on hunger strike from 21 February 2025 until 16 March 2025, in protest of his ongoing detention and the denial of bail. He was sentenced under the royal defamation law on 25 March 2024 to two years in prison for a speech he made at a rally in November 2020, where he allegedly criticized the monarchy. Despite multiple bail applications, all of which have been denied, Khanun’s health is rapidly deteriorating. He has lost significant weight and is experiencing serious health issues, yet the authorities did not granted him proper medical care. This case highlights continuing concerns about political repression and restrictions on fundamental freedoms in Thailand.

"Legislative Momentum for Gender Equality during 8M Protests","Event Summary
In light of recent developments during the 8M (March 8) mobilizations, there is a window of opportunity for gender justice advocacy in Chile. The government, under President Boric, has proposed significant gender equality reforms, including a National Care System, a constitutional reform for gender parity in elections, and a free abortion bill. Despite political uncertainties, particularly the lack of a parliamentary majority, these proposals represent a critical chance to advance gender equity policies. With the 8M march drawing 15,000 participants, the level of public engagement provides a key moment for advocacy efforts to gain momentum. The protest remained largely peaceful, with only a few isolated incidents reported.
Key opportunities:

Legislative Momentum: The proposed gender equity policies mark significant progress for gender justice. However, given the uncertain political landscape, advocacy efforts will be essential to build support for their passage.
Election Year Dynamics: As President Boric enters his final year in office, there is a strategic opportunity to push reforms forward while his political capital remains. Although the lack of a parliamentary majority is a challenge, the upcoming elections could shift political incentives, creating new openings for legislative progress.
Civic Engagement: The strong turnout at the 8M march demonstrates sustained public mobilization, presenting an opportune moment for advocacy campaigns to build pressure on lawmakers.

"Critiziced Cyber Security and Cyber Crimes Bills Could Soon Become Law","
Event Summary



On 28 March 2025, the Zambian Parliament passed the Cyber Security Bill, 2024, and the Cyber Crimes Bill, 2024, during the Third Reading, despite strong opposition from civil society organizations (CSOs). These bills are now awaiting the President&#8217;s signature to become law. The Ministry of Technology and Science reported that extensive consultations with stakeholders, including CSOs, the private sector, and international partners, were conducted after the Bills were initially deferred in December 2024. Once signed into law by President Hakainde Hichilema, the bills are expected to enhance digital security, protect national infrastructure, and address emerging cyber threats. However, several CSOs, including MISA Zambia, BBC Media Action, the Law Association of Zambia (LAZ), Chapter One Foundation, Bloggers of Zambia, and the Non-Governmental Gender Organisations Coordinating Council (NGOCC), expressed concerns over certain provisions. These civil society actors have highlighted the following criticisms: many of their recommended amendments to protect human rights were ignored; the bills contain unclear language that can lead to broad interpretations, potentially allowing for arbitrary implementation; they grant the government extensive surveillance capabilities, which could infringe on citizens&#8217; privacy rights; they do not sufficiently safeguard against government overreach, which could stifle media freedom, silence dissent, and limit free speech online; and the provisions related to data protection are seen as insufficient, leaving citizens vulnerable to privacy violations. As the Bills await the President&#8217;s signature, CSOs argue that they still lack critical safeguards against abuse.

"Parliament Passes Counter Terrorism Act Despite Clauses Threatening Civic Space","Event Summary
On Tuesday, 11th March 2025, the Parliament of Sierra Leone passed the National Counter-Terrorism Act 2025 which is currently awaiting the President&#8217;s signature. This Act aims to contribute to global efforts to combat terrorism. However, many critics argue that once this bill is signed into law, it is prone to be weaponised to further clamp down on dissent and shrink the enabling environment for civil society organizations (CSOs) and journalists operating in the country. Local and international activists, rights organizations, and press freedom groups, including the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists (SLAJ), Legal Link, and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), have expressed concerns about the Act. The CPJ highlights that certain sections of the bill make it a criminal offense to share information that the sender either knows to be false or has reasonable grounds to suspect is false, and that violations of these sections are punishable by life imprisonment and 15 years in prison. The bill grants authorities broad powers to request and obtain information from any person or authority whenever they deem it necessary. There are other issues, such the definition of terrorist acts, criminalising information dissemination, and harsh penalties and lack of safeguards that remain very contentious. These clauses pose risks to journalists covering protests and civil actions. Civil society has called on President Bio not to sign the Bill into law, fearing it will harm civic and political freedoms. This concern is compounded by the already present Cybercrime Law 2021 and the Public Order Act of 1965.

"Charges Against 'Gempur Rasuah Sabah' Protest Coordinator Withdrawn","Event Summary
On 21 February 2025, student activist and Gempur Rasuah Sabah protest coordinator Fadhil Kasim was summoned at Kota Kinabalu District Police Headquarters. He was charged under Section 9(5) of the Peaceful Assembly Act for organising the protest without &#8216;complying with notification procedures&#8217; and Section 509 of the Penal Code for his protest speech criticising the appointment of Sabah Governor Tun Musa Aman. Court hearings were scheduled for 21 and 22 April 2025.  The charge order had been issued earlier on 10 February 2025 and was based on police investigations into the Gempur Rasuah Sabah protest organised by students from Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) on 31 December 2024. Although Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced an immediate moratorium on assembly investigations under Section 11 of the Peaceful Assembly Act (PAA) pending legislative amendments, the Attorney-General&#8217;s Chambers (AGC) instructed police on 17 February 2025 to proceed with the charges. This was despite the police having referred the matter back to the AGC following the moratorium announcement.  
On 25 February 2025, however, the AGC issued a statement announcing that it had, &#8216;after detailed consideration&#8217;, decided to discontinue proceedings against individuals involved in the protest. No reasons were provided for this reversal. Notably, a similar anti-corruption protest held in Kuala Lumpur in January 2025, with Fadhil among its organisers, faced no such repercussions despite comparable circumstances. 
Fadhil was one of at least three student organisers summoned for police investigations in early January 2025 following the protest that had already been subjected to police warnings and restrictions despite its peaceful nature.

"Provincial Partnership Dialogues (PPDs): Promising Step for Local CSO Engagement in Cambodia","Event Summary
Event Name:
Provincial Partnership Dialogues (PPDs): Promising Step for Local CSO Engagement in Cambodia
Event Summary:
On 28 February 2025, Cambodia’s Ministry of Interior (MoI) issued a renewed directive to provincial administrations to prepare and conduct Provincial Partnership Dialogues (PPDs), a new initiative aimed at fostering more systematic engagement between provincial authorities and civil society organizations (CSOs) at the subnational level. This initiative follows the 6th Government–CSO Partnership Forum held in December 2024, where CSOs called for more regular and structured mechanisms for dialogue at the local level. The MoI’s announcement signals a potentially positive development in state–civil society engagement, demonstrating government responsiveness to CSO demands.
The PPD initiative was initially introduced on 31 October 2018 by the MoI to foster more systematic engagement between provincial authorities and CSOs. However, implementation had remained inconsistent, with several provinces failing to convene the dialogues as required.
In 2025, initial PPDs have been conductedin Battambang (6 January) and Banteay Meanchey (19 March), with positive feedback from CSOs. In Battambang, local CSO representatives report improved coordination and communication with provincial authorities, as well as greater openness to collaboration—provided sensitive or politically related issues are avoided. PPD reports are expected to be submitted to the MoI by provincial administrations, but some delays have been noted.
While the initiative has yet to be rolled out nationwide and remains limited in scope and content, it offers an institutionalized space for dialogue that may support better mutual understanding, problem-solving, and cooperation between government and civil society actors. The extent to which the mechanism will be inclusive and responsive remains to be seen.

"Investigative Journalist Ahmad Noorani Charged Under Cybercrime Law, His Brothers Abducted","Event Summary
Event Title: Investigative Journalism Under Fire: Ahmad Noorani Charged Under Cybercrime Law, Brothers Abducted
&nbsp;
Event alert:
Pakistani investigative journalist Ahmad Noorani, and co-founder of FactFocus, has been at the center of escalating tensions between the press and the military establishment over the last three years.  Noorani is a fact-based investigative journalist who has always provided factual reports to check state power and expose the wealth, power and influence that top military officials and their families have accumulated. In March 2025, Noorani dropped another explosive report, “Army Chief or a King: GHQ Tightens Grip on Civilian Institutions Under General Asim Munir,” which revealed how serving Army Chief General Asim Munir had planted several of his relatives and close associates in key civilian positions in violation of rules. The report also claimed that Munir’s married daughters had been issued diplomatic passports without authorization, in violation of foreign service regulations.
When this report was released, Noorani was arrested by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in three cases of cyberterrorism and defamation of state institutions for allegedly spreading false information about state institutions. Just days later, his two brothers Saifur Rehman Haider and Muhammad Ali, both engineers with no connection to journalism, were abducted from their home in Islamabad by unidentified individuals thought to be linked to intelligence agencies. When her sons were abducted, their mother had to go to the Islamabad High Court and file a habeas corpus petition, claiming that the abduction was a retaliatory act to make Noorani pay for his investigative work. Up to now, Noorani has gone into exile and his brothers have not been seen.
The case of Ahmad Noorani is not an isolated incident but rather part of a consistent and escalating pattern of repression against journalists, dissenters, and human rights defenders in Pakistan. Over the past year, there have been multiple instances where journalists have faced harassment, abduction, or legal persecution for exposing the misconduct of powerful institutions, particularly the military. Noorani himself was previously targeted after publishing an investigative report on the wealth of former Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa. In many of these cases, the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) has been misused as a legal weapon to stifle press freedom, using vague provisions such as “cyberterrorism” and “spreading false information” to justify arrests and censorship. What makes Noorani’s case even more alarming is the abduction of his brothers, which highlights a growing tactic of punishing family members to silence journalists working from abroad. This pattern points to a deeper erosion of democratic norms in Pakistan, where legal tools and state institutions are increasingly being manipulated to suppress dissent, protect elite interests, and deter investigative journalism. This results in self-censorship, less investigative journalism and a weaker media. For instance, after Noorani’s report, other media houses didn’t pick up the story from there, because they feared the repercussions.

Between 20 and 22 March 2025, security forces in Quetta violently suppressed peaceful protests led by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) and other civil society actors. The demonstrations were triggered by the burial of 13 bodies—believed by families to be forcibly disappeared individuals—without proper identification procedures. Protesters demanded transparency and justice. The crackdown involved police violence, internet shutdowns, and arrests. At least three protesters were reportedly killed.
At the forefront of the protests was Dr. Mahrang Baloch, a prominent human rights defender and spokesperson of the BYC, known for advocating for the rights of Baloch families and survivors of enforced disappearance. Protesters demanded proper procedures and justice. The crackdown involved police violence, internet shutdowns, and the arrest of Dr. Baloch, who remains in detention as of April 2025, despite national and international calls for her release.
This incident has been widely condemned by UN experts and human rights groups, who see it as part of a broader pattern of systematic repression against civic activism in Balochistan. This event exemplifies the use of excessive force, anti-terror laws, and digital repression to silence peaceful dissent, especially from marginalized groups.

"Appeal hearings for 11 environmental defenders and leaders sentenced in 2024","Event Summary
In 2024, eleven leaders of peasant communities and environmental defenders from the provinces of Cotabambas and Grau, in the Apurímac region, were sentenced in the first instance to eight and nine years in prison. The charges included aggravated property damage, civil disturbance, and obstruction of public services, in the context of protests against the Las Bambas mining project.
The first-instance ruling was criticized by national and international organizations such as CooperAcción, Red Muqui, Fedepaz, and Front Lines Defenders, which pointed to irregularities, undue delays, and a lack of legal safeguards. As a result, they described the case as a criminalization of protest. In this context, the defense has appealed for the revocation of the ruling and the dismissal of the order to pay civil reparations, arguing that the prosecution’s case lacks sufficient evidence. The hearing originally scheduled for 31 March 2025 took place, but it was not concluded and was rescheduled to continue on 4 April 2025.
The evidence presented and the ruling in this case will help clarify the events and establish legal precedents for justice processes related to social protests and environmental defense. A verdict is expected on 22 April 2025.
Local residents, civil society organizations, and the Provincial Municipality of Cotabambas all rallied in support of the defenders, expressing their concern and solidarity through social media and public demonstrations.

"SUSPENSION INOPINEE DE L'AIDE AMERICAINE  AU DEVELOPPEMENTS: GEL DES ACTIVITES DU PROJET SICEA","Event Summary
The Meeting for Peace and Human Rights (RPDH) has suspended its project Stopping Impunity for Corruption in Africa (SICEA), conducted with the support of Transparency International – TI, following the Trump administration&#8217;s decision to suspend US development aid for 90 days on January 20, 2025. This suspension abruptly interrupted the regular implementation of the project and had a negative impact on the organization.
SICEA is a pilot project of several TI sections, including two (02) in Central Africa, notably the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo, which is the regional hub. The American government is the main donor through USAID. By email dated January 24, 2025, the RPDH was notified of the suspension of the project by the new American administration for a period of 3 months. This suspension stopped the efforts made in the fight against impunity for corruption, through actions aimed at encouraging the Congolese authorities and judicial system to handle more corruption cases, a scourge that undermines African economies, hinders their development, and causes the continent to lose more than 140 billion euros per year, according to the African Development Bank. This abrupt cessation of the grant therefore has a significant impact on the project&#8217;s activities on the one hand, marking a halt to the progress made, and on the other hand on the social balance of the staff employed by the project.

"Increasing threats against journalists following the revision of Indonesia’s National Armed Forces Law","Event Summary
On 20 March 2025, the Indonesian House of Representatives (DPR) approved the revision of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) Law. The revision has the potential to lead Indonesia back into a military dictatorship and has been met with widespread protests. Amnesty International Indonesia reported that during the protests, police used excessive force, leading to injuries and arrests among demonstrators, including journalists covering these events.
While journalists reporting critically on the government have faced harassment before, the current repression against journalists reporting on the TNI law revision constitutes a significant escalation of this trend.  The environment for journalists has become increasingly perilous as they face threats not only from military personnel but also from state apparatuses attempting to suppress dissent against the TNI Law revision. Particularly, the military has emerged as a source of violence against journalists.
Notable cases of attacks against journalists include:

Adhyasta Dirgantara, a journalist from Kompas.com, received threats from aides of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) Commander on February 27, 2025.
Francisca Christy Rosana, a journalist from Tempo, received a terror threat involving a shipment of a pig’s head with its ears cut off on March 19, 2025. Additionally, on March 22, 2025, she also received a shipment of a headless rat.
On March 19, 2025, a female journalist named Juwita was killed by a member of the Navy.
On April 4, 2025, a journalist with the initials SW was murdered at Hotel D’Paragon
On April 5, 2025, several journalists received threats and experienced physical violence while covering an event involving the Chief of the Indonesian National Police (Kapolri) in Semarang. This was carried out by aides of the Kapolri.
Since April 7, 2025, the Tempo website has been continuously experiencing Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) cyber attacks. This stems from an investigative report titled “Tentakel Judi Kamboja,” which mentions Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, a high-ranking official in the Gerindra Party of President Prabowo Subianto
On April 9, 2025, Hadi Hadrian, a journalist from Hadejabar.com, was assaulted while covering an event in Subang, West Java.
On April 11, 2025, the home of Joko Purnomo, a journalist from DetikNews, was attacked with a Molotov cocktail by unknown individuals.

The continuation of violence and intimidation against journalists not only threatens individual safety but also poses significant risks to the overall democratic landscape in Indonesia. Without effective measures to protect journalists and uphold press freedom, the enabling environment for democracy will continue to deteriorate, ultimately affecting civic space and public participation in governance.

"Journalists attacked while investigating a worksite run by a state-contracted company","Event Summary
On 21 February 2025, journalists from MCRTV-NF were verbally and physically assaulted by security agents from the company China State Construction Engineering Corporation Congo (CSCEC) while reporting in Pointe-Noire’s Siafoumou neighbourhood. The team was investigating whether construction on a drainage project had ceased, following a suspension order by the Minister of the Environment. Despite the order, the company &#8211; that is executing a public contract &#8211; continued its work and attempted to block the journalists from filming, citing unauthorised access. This attack not only obstructed press freedom but also violated freedom of information.
The case was reported to the High Council for Freedom of Information and Communication (CLSC), the media regulatory body, which in such circumstances conducts the necessary due diligence as a media protection institution. To date, there has been no feedback from the CLSC nor other government authorities to protect the journalists or uphold press freedom, leaving MCRTV-NF concerned for the safety and integrity of its staff as they continue exposing the situation.

"USAID funding freeze sends shockwaves through Ugandan civil society","Event Summary

On 28 January 2025, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) formally notified all its implementing partners about the suspension of funding for foreign assistance programs. This action was taken following President Trump’s Executive Order on Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid, reflecting a broader shift in U.S. foreign policy objectives. The decision has raised serious concerns within the civil society sector, as USAID has traditionally been a major donor, covering nearly half of the annual budgets for some Civil Society Organizations (CSOs). The sudden halt in funding has created significant uncertainty regarding the sustainability of key programs in governance and human rights sectors that have long relied on external financial support. From strengthening electoral processes to improving access to healthcare and education, the agency’s funding has played a critical role in shaping the country’s progress. The withdrawal of USAID has also had far-reaching impacts on local communities in Uganda given the significant role USAID has played in supporting the essential sectors of health, education, governance, and food security.
The funding pause comes at a particularly challenging time, as the civil society sector is still grappling with the aftermath of the closure of the Democracy Governance Facility (DGF), a multi-donor fund that had sustained operations in the sector for nearly 12 years. The loss of DGF funding disrupted many programmes aimed at strengthening democratic institutions, promoting civic engagement, and enhancing government accountability. The absence of this funding stream left many organizations struggling to secure alternative financial support, thereby weakening their operational capacity. In addition to USAID’s withdrawal, several development partners and international agencies, including those from the Netherlands, Sweden, France, and Switzerland, have significantly reduced their funding allocations to CSOs. This trend, observed over the past few years, indicates a broader shift in global development financing, with increasing prioritization of domestic concerns over international development efforts. Projections suggest that these funding reductions will continue, exacerbating the resource constraints faced by CSOs worldwide.
As a result, many CSOs are experiencing disruptions, including the paralysis of critical activities, severe budget cuts, termination of staff contracts, and increased difficulty in meeting the stringent NGO regulatory framework requirements. These financial constraints hinder the ability of civil society to play its watchdog role effectively, limiting their capacity to advocate for human rights, good governance, and transparency. Additionally, organizations working on election monitoring, civic education, and policy advocacy face heightened vulnerabilities, as the withdrawal of funding significantly reduces their ability to operate independently and effectively. Due to the funding freeze, many NGOs will struggle to meet the financial and operational requirements mandated by the NGO Law. This could lead to compliance challenges, risking penalties, suspension, or closure.

"Prisión de defensor ambiental y reclamos sobre derecho a defender los derechos humanos","Event Summary
A finales de marzo, día 26, fue detenido el defensor ambiental Vidal Brítez, quien permanece actualmente con prisión domiciliaria obtenida luego de denuncias  y reclamos realizados por pobladores de su región de origen y por organismos de derechos humanos, los que alertaron sobre la arbitrariedad del hecho y la criminalización de la protesta socioambiental.  La detención de Britez, pequeño productor y presidente de la Asociación de Yerbateros de Paso Yobai, se produce en medio de un conflicto de larga data entre mineros dedicados a la extracción de oro y productores de yerba mate, en la localidad de Paso Yobai, región del Guairá, centro-sur del país.
La orden de captura había sido emitida por agentes fiscales, sobre hecho punible de coacción grave. Refiere al suceso de manifestación de productores de yerba mate, derivado en posterior enfrentamiento con mineros, acontecido en Paso Yobai el pasado 10 de enero,  donde supuestamente se encontraba Brítez. Al reclamo sobre la penalización de la protesta que fuera realizada por los productores dadas las reiteradas denuncias no respondidas sobre el uso de contaminantes para la explotación del oro, como la apertura de múltiples piletas para dicho efecto,  y sus  impactos adversos en la producción de la yerba mate, los suelos y las aguas, se ha sumado el hecho de que Britez no se encontraba el día 10 de enero en dicha movilización, como alega la acusación fiscal.  Por el contrario, se encontraba fuera del lugar y se había comunicado en la fecha con una emisora de radio local, informando sobre las graves noticas recibidas y solicitando la mediación del intendente municipal, con quien dialogó en dicho programa radial.  El proceso afrontado por este defensor ambiental, ahora con prisión domiciliaria mientras dure la investigación fiscal y se abra el juicio, da cuenta de vulneración a las libertades de expresión y asociación con base en disposiciones no claras del ámbito judicial, criminalizando a defensores de intereses socioambientales colectivos, y políticas públicas no abiertas al juego democrático de la participación e intereses de actores diversos.

"Apropiación ilegítima de tierras y amenazas contra la prensa en el caso Kailasa","Event Summary
Entre septiembre de 2024 y marzo de 2025, se hicieron públicos varios acuerdos firmados entre representantes de pueblos indígenas de Bolivia y personas vinculadas al autodenominado “Estado de Kailasa”, una entidad ficticia no reconocida internacionalmente. Según reportes, estos convenios —firmados sin consulta previa ni supervisión estatal, y en inglés— cedían hasta 481.000 hectáreas de territorios indígenas a Kailasa por un plazo de mil años. A cambio, las comunidades recibirían un pago anual simbólico. La Confederación de Pueblos Indígenas de Bolivia (CIDOB) y el Territorio Indígena Multiétnico II (TIM II) denunciaron públicamente que los acuerdos fueron firmados bajo engaño, aprovechando la vulnerabilidad de ciertas comunidades y cooptando a dirigentes locales.
Además del intento de apropiación territorial, el caso afectó gravemente el espacio cívico: periodistas y medios que investigaron los hechos —como El Deber, Sumando Voces y Brújula Digital— fueron amenazados por representantes legales de Kailasa con posibles acciones legales si no se retractaban. Si bien la Cancillería boliviana aclaró que no reconoce a Kailasa y 20 de sus representantes fueron deportados, hasta el momento no se ha avanzado públicamente en la anulación oficial de los convenios, ni se han abierto procesos judiciales sustantivos. Las asociaciones nacionales de periodistas de Bolivia y en Santa Cruz han expresado su preocupación por la falta de acción del Estado para proteger la libertad de prensa.
El caso Kailasa revela graves debilidades institucionales en el control sobre negociaciones que afectan derechos colectivos, así como una preocupante permisividad frente a actores externos que vulneran la soberanía y los derechos indígenas. También pone de manifiesto el creciente riesgo de intimidación contra periodistas y medios que denuncian hechos de interés público. Todo esto contribuye a un entorno de inseguridad jurídica, autocensura mediática y pérdida de confianza de las organizaciones sociales hacia el Estado.

"Ethnic armed groups in Myanmar carry out extrajudicial killings of convicted criminals","Event Summary
On 10 April 2025, in Lashio City (N. Shan State), the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) held a public trial and sentenced five people to death and executed them immediately after. The five, including one Chinese national, were convicted of rape, murder and theft. They were executed by firing squad in front of open pits near Lashio airport. The MNDAA also handed life sentences to two others, including a Chinese national, and deferred a death sentence to another for an additional two years. This highlights a concerning trend among ethnic armed groups (but also the Junta) in Burma of undemocratically enforcing law and order, without proper legal mechanisms during times of war. The execution of suspected or convicted criminals without giving them access to lawyers or the opportunity to appeal goes against international legal standards and amounts to extrajudicial killings and serious human rights violations.
On 7 April 2025, in Laiza Town (Kachin State), the Kachin Independent Organisation (KIO) executed a man for the torture, rape and murder of three young girls at an IDP camp in Feb 2025. On 29 March 2025, a KIO court sentenced the man, who was also the girls’ teacher’s husband, to death. He was executed by firing squad.

"CSO prevented from accessing communities in the Tchiamba Nzassi district","Event Summary
On Thursday, 27 March 2025, the civil society organisation Rencontre pour la Paix et les Droits de l’Homme (RPDH) was blocked from conducting its activities in the Tchiamba Nzassi district of Pointe-Noire Department. The RPDH team was attempting to visit communities near the Kayo and Mbanga Kayo oil sites operated by the Chinese company WING-WAH, as part of their “PAPCo – Preparing for Post-Oil in Congo” project. The sub-prefect of Tchiamba Nzassi district denied them access, stating that approval from his superiors was required. The delegation was asked to return later for permission. Upon returning a week later on 2 April 2025, they were again prevented from accessing and meeting the communities, as the sub-prefect still had not received the necessary approval. As of April 2025, the RPDH has been unable to engage with the communities in the area, delaying their project activities. The ongoing restrictions violate fundamental rights such as freedom of association and the right to access information.

"Civil society actors appointed in Reconciliation Process Taskforce","Event Summary


In April 2025, the Timor-Leste Government, through the Centro Nacional Chega Instituto Publiku (CNC), appointed various civil society actors—including NGOs, resistance groups from the Indonesian occupation era, veterans, and foundations operating in Timor-Leste—as members of the taskforce group known as the &#8220;Timorese Reconciliation Process&#8221; (PRT). This group was formed to assist the CNC in organizing and facilitating reconciliation efforts for those involved in political conflicts from 1974 to 1999.




Notable civil society actors invited to join the taskforce include the HAK Foundation, RENETIL, ACBIT, and others. On 4 April 2025, the taskforce held a reconciliation dialogue in Liquica Municipality, bringing together victims of the Liquica massacre and some of its perpetrators. This indicates an improvement in collaborations between government and civil society.

"Hong Kong National Security Police Questions Parents of Fugitive Activist Frances Hui","Event Summary
On 10 April 2025, Hong Kong national security police took away the parents of US-based activist Frances Hui Wing-ting for questioning from their home in Ma On Shan, Sha Tin. They were escorted to two separate police stations and released in the afternoon. This marks the second time Hui&#8217;s mother has been questioned, following a previous interrogation in December 2023. Frances Hui, 25, is among 19 activists with HK$1 million bounties, wanted for allegedly violating the National Security Law. She is specifically accused of colluding with foreign countries to endanger national security by repeatedly calling for sanctions against China. Hui fled Hong Kong in 2020 and was granted political asylum in the US in 2022. She currently works as a policy and advocacy coordinator at the Washington-based Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation.

"Amendment to the Law Against Non-Recognition of the Crimes Committed During the Democratic Kampuchea Period has passed","Event Summary
The Cambodian government has already passed an amended law against the denial of Khmer Rouge-era crimes. The amended law was passed through​ a rushed process without any consultation of CSOs. The national assembly approved it on 18 February 2025, and the Senate approved it on 26 February 2025. Subsequently, the law was officially issued by Royal Decree on 1 March 2025, which introduces harsher penalties for individuals with differing viewpoints and restricts public discourse and freedom of expression about the event that occurred.​​ This law aims to record the Cambodian dark regime&#8217;s destruction and punish those who refuse to acknowledge the truth about the past.

"Crackdown on newsroom by Mongolian police","Event Summary
On 17 March 2025, Mongolian police raided the newsroom of Noorog, an independent media outlet in Ulaanbaatar, seizing equipment and interrogating eight staff members overnight. Initially accused of &#8220;undermining national unity,&#8221; the journalists have faced shifting allegations, including &#8220;illegal gambling&#8221; and &#8220;spreading false information&#8221; &#8211; raising concerns that the charges are politically motivated..
The raid is seen as a tactic linked to Noorog&#8217;s upcoming documentary on Mongolia’s 2024 parliamentary elections, which examines political party tactics to influence voters. Press freedom organisations, including Reporters Without Borders, have condemned the operation as an attack on independent journalism, warning that shows a troubling trend of media suppression in Mongolia.
Government officials, however, maintain that the investigation is based on legal grounds, citing complaints that Noorog’s content may have contributed to suicide risks and violated gambling laws. They emphasize that the investigation is ongoing and stress the importance of allowing due process to unfold.
The case has sparked broader debate over the balance between press freedom and government oversight in Mongolia. While critics fear a chilling effect on independent journalism, authorities assert that legal accountability must apply equally to all media actors. The outcome of this investigation may have lasting implications for the country’s media landscape. The controversy may further weaken public trust in civil society organizations

"Activists given Sedition Sentences Under Safeguarding National Security Ordinance","Event Summary
The 2024 Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) in Hong Kong has increased restrictions on freedom of expression, leading to the imprisonment of two activists in April 2025 for alleged seditious acts through social media posts and graffiti. On 8 April 2025, Chow Kim-ho, a 57-year-old former member of the pro-democracy group League of Social Democrats, was sentenced to one year in prison after pleading guilty to publishing 145 seditious comments on social media platforms between March and November 2024. His posts included hashtags calling for the &#8220;extermination of the Chinese Communist Party&#8221; and describing the Hong Kong government as a &#8220;murderous and authoritarian regime.&#8221; In a separate case on 12 April 2025, a 53-year-old logistics worker Ernest Lee was sentenced to 10 months in prison after pleading guilty to one count of committing acts with seditious intention and four counts of criminal damage. Lee had written slogans about Taiwan independence and criticisms of the Chinese Communist Party on lift doors and banners in multiple locations across Hong Kong between May and December 2024. Both cases were heard by designated national security judge Victor So at the West Kowloon Magistrates&#8217; Courts. These cases add to the growing number of convictions under sedition laws in Hong Kong, reflecting the continued deterioration of freedom of expression and protest for the civil society.

"Junta agrees to repatriate 180,000 Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh","Event Summary
On 4 April 2025, the Bangladeshi government reported that the Burmese military junta had agreed to repatriate 180,000 Rohingya refugees living in Bangladesh back to Burma. Bangladeshi officials stated that the 180,000 names were part of a larger list of 800,000 Rohingya individuals that Bangladesh had provided to Burma in six separate submissions from 2018 to 2020. The junta has not given any official responses regarding the repatriation.
The junta had also reportedly notified Bangladesh that an additional 70,000 names were awaiting final verification, as officials continued to examine photographs and identity details. The junta also reportedly pledged to expedite the verification process for the remaining 550,000 individuals on the list.
However, it is unclear why the junta has gone forward with this repatriation plan and what will happen to the Rohingya if they return to Burma.

"Journalists' Release Highlights Urgent Need for Reform of Jordan's Cybercrime Law","Event Summary
On 13 February 2025, journalist Hiba Abu Taha was released from prison after completing her sentence and paying a fine under Jordan’s 2023 Cybercrime Law. Abu Taha’s imprisonment stemmed from her reporting on Jordan-Israel relations, a subject which led to her conviction under the controversial law. Her release, along with that of fellow journalist Ahmed Al-Zoubi in January 2025, offers a significant opportunity for advocacy against the Cybercrime Law, which has drawn widespread criticism for its impact on press freedom and freedom of expression.
This event presents a critical moment for civil society actors, both domestically and internationally, to intensify their advocacy efforts for the reconsideration or repeal of the law. Notably, Jordan&#8217;s government had accepted a recommendation from the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in January 2024 to reconsider the law, but little progress has been made. The release of these journalists provides a timely platform to push for meaningful legislative reform.

"Lynching of Ahmadi man heightens insecurity for religious minorities and advocates","Event Summary
On 18 April 2025, Laeeq Ahmad Cheema, a 46-year-old member of the Ahmadiyya community, was brutally lynched by a mob in Karachi, Pakistan. The mob, reportedly affiliated with the far-right Islamist group Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), had gathered outside the Ahmadi place of worship, chanting anti-Ahmadi slogans and attempting to damage the premises. Cheema, who was approximately 150 meters away from the hall, was identified by members of the mob and attacked with sticks and bricks. He succumbed to his injuries before receiving medical treatment. Following Cheema’s killing, law enforcement agencies identified six suspects, including a Union Council chairman linked to TLP, through CCTV footage. However, the broader state response has been criticized as slow and inadequate. Human rights organizations, including the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, have strongly condemned the incident, characterizing it as a grave failure of law and order and reflective of a broader pattern of systematic repression against religious minorities in Pakistan.
The lynching of Laeeq Ahmad Cheema is not an isolated event. At the heart of the violence is the persistent and systematic persecution of the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan. Self-identifying as Muslims but declared non-Muslims under the 1974 constitutional amendment and criminalized in their religious practice under Ordinance XX of 1984, Ahmadis face entrenched legal discrimination that enables societal hostility and emboldens extremist groups like TLP. Regular protests, hate campaigns, and targeted violence against Ahmadis are common, creating a climate where attacks are normalized and perpetrators often enjoy impunity. The targeted attacks on the Ahmadiyya community exemplify a deepening crisis of religious intolerance and state complicity.
The lynching of Laeeq Ahmad Cheema has a profoundly negative impact on the enabling environment for civil society, religious freedom, and human rights in Pakistan. This incident has heightened fear and insecurity among religious minorities, particularly the Ahmadiyya community, discouraging their participation in public life, religious gatherings, and advocacy efforts. Civil society organizations working on minority rights and religious freedom now face greater threats, surveillance, and harassment, making their operations even more restricted and risky. Human rights defenders are also experiencing a chilling effect, with growing fears of reprisal for speaking out against religious discrimination or state inaction. There is also a strong risk of increased misuse of blasphemy laws and hate speech to target not only Ahmadis but also broader civil society voices advocating for human rights and tolerance.
The state’s failure to prevent or promptly address mob violence emboldens extremist groups and normalizes impunity. Unless addressed urgently, this event signals a dangerous future where extremism strengthens. Advocacy efforts should focus on demanding an independent investigation into the incident, ensuring the prosecution of both the attackers and those who incited the violence, and holding law enforcement accountable for their inaction. Legal reforms must be prioritized, particularly the repeal of discriminatory laws such as Ordinance XX and the strengthening of protection mechanisms for religious minorities. Public awareness campaigns should aim to humanize Ahmadis and expose networks that propagate hate speech, while international advocacy should engage UN bodies and leverage Pakistan’s obligations under international human rights treaties.

"Conflict Between Ming Pao Editorial and Secretary for Security over Press Freedom","Event Summary
On 27 March 2025, Ming Pao, a respected Hong Kong newspaper, published an editorial defending its journalist who had questioned Secretary for Security Chris Tang Ping-keung about the lack of gazettal (official public notice) for his recent trip to Thailand. The editorial asserted the legitimacy of such journalistic inquiries, especially in the context of government transparency. In response, Tang issued a strongly worded letter criticising the editorial as “biased and misleading”. He claimed the trip involved a covert operation related to rescuing Hong Kongers held captive abroad, which required confidentiality to protect lives. Tang insisted the media’s focus on administrative procedures rather than the security mission’s necessity and sensitivity was irresponsible. This exchange has reignited debate around press freedom and government accountability in Hong Kong.

"Restrictions Imposed on Public Access to District Councillors’ Work Reports","Event Summary
On 1 April 2025, the Hong Kong government began releasing the annual reports of the 470 serving District Councillors. However, access was restricted: members of the public must visit District Offices in person to view the documents, and a new clause now prohibits photographing them. While photocopies are available for a fee, the added rule prevents citizens from freely and efficiently documenting the content. The Home Affairs Department justified the new measure as necessary to ensure the “accuracy and integrity” of the documents. Still, this lack of transparency drew public and political criticism. Legislative Councillor Tik Chi-yuen accused the government of “procedural obstruction”, calling for the reports to be made fully available online to promote openness and accountability. Critics argue that the move represents yet another attempt by the Hong Kong authorities to reduce public oversight over elected representatives, particularly following the overhaul of the District Council system in 2023, which already limited democratic participation.

"Government denial on enforced disappearances threatens enabling environment","Event Summary
In April 2025, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum sent a note to the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances (CED) rejecting the existence of enforced disappearances in the country, despite the discovery of mass graves and over 125,000 missing persons. The CED has called for urgent measures, such as protecting evidence and ensuring transparent investigations. However, the Mexican government and the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) deny that these disappearances are a state policy, attributing them to organized crime. This position undermines fundamental principles of the civic space: the principle of an open and receptive state is affected by the official denial, shutting down dialogue and accountability.
Additionally, the principle of political culture and public discourse toward civil society is undermined by statements that delegitimize the voices of victims and civil society organisations, such as the collectives of mothers searching for their disappeared loved ones. The official rejection could lead to the stigmatisation and criminalisation of these collectives, hindering their work. This creates a more restrictive environment for civil society organisations and limits cooperation with international human rights mechanisms, severely impacting the enabling environment for civil society in Mexico.

"Court Upholds Acquittal of Democratic Party Chairperson for Taking Part in Unlawful Assembly","Event Summary
On 21 March 2025, the Court of Appeal upheld the acquittal of Democratic Party Chairperson Law Kin-hee, who had previously been charged with participating in an unlawful assembly in support of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) protesters during the 2019 unrest. The court rejected an appeal by the Department of Justice, maintaining the original verdict issued in November 2022 by the District Court. Law was initially arrested in November 2019 near the Hong Kong Science Museum in Tsim Sha Tsui. He was accused of being involved in an unlawful assembly aimed at supporting the protesters at PolyU. Law denied the charges, and the District Court ruled that the evidence was insufficient to prove his intent to participate in the unauthorized gathering, leading to his acquittal. This decision is significant in the context of the Enabling Environment for Civil Society, as it underscores the ongoing legal battles faced by individuals involved in public demonstrations. The acquittal suggests that, despite significant state scrutiny, individuals can challenge unlawful assembly charges if the evidence fails to support claims of intent or participation.

"Military government to relocate buildings and ministries after earthquake, possibly increasing tensions in Yangon","Event Summary
On 16 April 2025, it was reported that the military regime planned to relocate several government buildings and ministries from the capital, Naypyidaw, to Yangon. This decision follows the 7.7 earthquake that struck Burma on 28 March, which destroyed around 80% of Naypyidaw&#8217;s government buildings and staff apartments. Myanmar Now reported that the regime plans to relocate the ministries of foreign affairs, agriculture and livestock, commerce, and the Central Bank. Additionally, DVB reported that the ministries of defense and education would also be relocated. Other sources indicated that the ministries of hotels and tourism, as well as immigration and population, would also be moved. However, reportedly, only certain administrative departments from each ministry are expected to relocate to Yangon. 
The anticipated threats posed by this event on the Enabling Environment are heightened security and further junta restrictions and arbitrary arrests in Yangon on the one side and increased attacks by resistance groups on the other side. Since the attempted coup, there have been many instances of resistance groups (with urban guerrilla tactics) targeting government and junta-occupied buildings, junta-linked companies, and junta military checkpoints through bombings and drive-by shootings.

"Dismissal of Union Activist Raises Concerns Over Labor Rights","Event Summary
In March 2025, an employee of a major Jordanian state water company was fired in retaliation for his involvement in organizing labor activities. The employee, a board member of the General Trade Union of Workers in Food Industries, was attempting to arrange a meeting between union representatives and the company’s management to discuss workers&#8217; demands. After the company rejected the meeting, they terminated the employee in early April 2025. This action violated Jordanian Labor Law, specifically Article (108), which prohibits retaliation against union representatives, as well as ILO Convention No. (98), which protects workers from dismissal due to union activities. The incident highlights growing concerns about labor rights and the potential for a chilling effect on union activism in Jordan, particularly for recognized unions. While the event has not yet escalated significantly, it signals potential threats to the enabling environment for labor activism, warranting close monitoring for future developments.

"Social Worker Jackie Chen Sentenced to More than 3 Years for Rioting Following Retrial","Event Summary
On 9 April 2025, Hong Kong social worker Jackie Chen Hung-sau was sentenced to 3 years and 9 months in prison after being convicted of rioting for her involvement in the 31 August 2019 protest. Deputy District Judge May Chung initially set the sentence at 5 years but reduced it by 15 months, taking into account Chen&#8217;s contributions as a social worker and volunteer, as well as the stress she endured during the lengthy legal proceedings. The sentencing followed Chen&#8217;s retrial and conviction on 12 March 2025, after the government successfully appealed her 2020 acquittal.
During the sentencing hearing, Judge Chung acknowledged that Chen had not engaged in violence at the scene but emphasized that her sentence had to reflect the actions of the entire crowd and the severity of the riot. Chen consistently argued throughout her trial that she had acted as a mediator between the police and protesters, using a loudspeaker to urge the police to exercise restraint. However, in the March verdict, the judge dismissed this claim, stating that Chen had &#8220;repeatedly shouted baseless accusations against the police&#8221; and &#8220;leveraged her social worker role to support the protesters.&#8221;
Chen now also faces the potential loss of her professional license due to recent amendments to the Social Workers Registration Ordinance, which allows for the deregistration of social workers convicted of offenses punishable by imprisonment that may harm the profession&#8217;s reputation.

"Arrested and detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act for pasting an ""anti-war in Gaza"" sticker","Event Summary
On 22 March 2025, Mohamed Rushdie, a young salesman at a shopping mall in Colombo was arrested and subsequently detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) for allegedly displaying a sticker critical of Israeli military actions in Gaza. The 90-day detention order, authorised by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in his role as Minister of Defense, cited “associating with members of extremist or terrorist organizations, motivated by extremist ideologies and acting in a manner detrimental to peace and harmony among communities and knowingly concealing such information from security forces.” The invocation of this draconian law against a peaceful act of protest starkly contradicts President Dissanayake’s own campaign promise to repeal the PTA​.
In response, demonstrators—including human rights advocates and members of the public—took to the streets to protest what was widely viewed as yet another blatant misuse of the PTA, raising serious concerns over the suppression of freedom of expression and speech.

"Secret Trial and Verdict in Human Rights Lawyer's Contempt of Court Case","Event Summary
Further worrying developments unfold in the trial of human rights lawyer Arnon Nampa, who is being prosecuted for comments made regarding the monarchy. In 2024, the Criminal Court had refused to issue subpoenas for evidence, explaining that the requested evidence would “violate” the “inviolable” King. Arnon protested by removing his t-shirt. The Court subsequently ordered a secret trial and threatened people who failed to leave the courtroom with detention. The Court also imposed a gag order on news dissemination, threatening prospective violators with a contempt of court charge and charged Arnon with contempt of court.
On 28 March 2025, the Criminal Court read the verdict in Arnon’s contempt of court case in secret, in the arraignment room on the 1st floor, in the absence of members of the public and Mr. Arnon’s family. It is important to note that the Thai Criminal Procedure Code explicitly requires that judgments be read in “open court.” The law does not provide any exceptions or provisions allowing the court to exercise discretion in reading a verdict in secret.

"Muslim Brotherhood banned and raided after arrests on terrorism- and weapons-related charges","Event Summary
On 23 April 2025, Jordan banned the Muslim Brotherhood, with the Ministry of Interior declaring it an illegal association, banning its activities, and announcing intentions to seize its property. Shortly after, authorities raided the Brotherhood’s office. There was also a raid on the office of the Muslim Brotherhood’s political party (the Islamic Action Front, which is a registered/legal political party), although it has not been banned. In 2020, a Jordanian upper court had formally dissolved the Muslim Brotherhood, but the court decision had not been enforced much practically — until now. The Brotherhood has been a leading organizing of pro-Palestine demonstrations since 7 October 2023 and this event fits into Jordan’s clamping down on Palestine activism.
The ban shortly follows an 15 April 2025 announcement by the government that it had foiled &#8220;a plot aimed at harming national security, sowing chaos&#8221; by 16 Muslim Brotherhood members planning an attack inside the Kingdom (as characterized by the government). These individuals have been charged on terrorism- and weapons-related charges, specifically regarding rockets said to have been found, which are now to be overseen by the security court. Confessions were aired on national television.

"Palestinian Supporters Arrested and Detained Without Charges","Event Summary
Since January 2025, over 20 individuals, primarily from Jordan&#8217;s Islamic movements, have been arrested for their support of the Palestinian resistance. Many remain detained without formal charges or clear details, raising serious concerns about violations of legal rights, including the use of administrative detention. The families of those detained have publicly opposed the arrests, organising a sit-in outside the Jordanian Parliament. However, despite growing attention, public mobilisation beyond the immediate families has remained limited.
This situation underscores ongoing restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly, particularly regarding pro-Palestine activism. Given the lack of transparency surrounding the arrests, civil society must advocate for procedural transparency and the strict application of the rule of law.

"Arrest of Boycott, Divest, Sanctions movement Coordinator under Cybercrime Law","Event Summary
On 6 May 2025, Jordanian security forces arrested Hamza Khader, a Jordanian activist and coordinator in the BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanctions) Jordan movement. The activist has not advocated the use of force. The arrest was reportedly made under provisions of the 2023 Cybercrime Law regarding Khader’s social media posts advocating for a boycott of Israel. Khader is currently held in detention at an unknown location, with no official information yet released about his arrest.
This arrest is part of a pattern in 2025, wherein varying kinds of political activity in support of the Palestinian cause have been constrained (see the other alerts published).
BDS Jordan has issued a statement condemning Khader’s arrest.

"Artisanal Fishermen Protesting Proposed Fishing Quota Legislation Clash with Police","Event Summary
In late March 2025, thousands of artisanal fishermen across Chile mobilized in protest against the proposed &#8220;Ley de Fraccionamiento Pesquero&#8221; (Fishing Quota Distribution Bill), which they argue disproportionately favors large industrial fishing companies. Demonstrations took place in key coastal cities, including Valparaíso—where clashes erupted outside the National Congress building between protesters and Carabineros (Chile&#8217;s national police). The protests involved blockades, marches, and confrontations with security forces who responded with water cannons and tear gas.
The controversy centers on revisions made to a government bill initially aimed at increasing fishing quotas for artisanal sectors, particularly for key species such as hake and cuttlefish. While the bill passed the lower house with a 70–90% quota allocation in favor of artisanal fishers, amendments introduced in the Senate significantly reduced these shares. Protesters claim that this change is a result of lobbying pressure from powerful industrial fishing groups and reflects a broader institutional bias.
These events have sparked national debate on marine resource governance, social equity, and the state’s responsiveness to marginalized communities. Fishermen have vowed to continue mobilizing until their demands for a fair quota distribution are met. The situation remains tense and has drawn attention from both human rights observers and environmental NGOs concerned about transparency and equity in Chile’s fisheries policy.

"Arrest of US scholar Paul Chambers on lèse-majesté charges","Event Summary
On 8 April 2025, Dr. Paul Wesley Chambers, an American academic affiliated with the Center of ASEAN Community Studies, Faculty of Social Sciences, Naresuan University, was charged under Section 112 (lèse-majesté) of Thailand’s Criminal Code and Section 14(1) (entering distorted, fake, or false computer data into the computer system in a manner likely to cause harm to the public) of the Computer Crimes Act B.E. 2550 (2007). That same day, the Phitsanulok Provincial Court approved his pretrial detention and denied his two bail requests, resulting in his immediate transfer to the Phitsanulok Provincial Prison. Since July 2020, no fewer than 279 people have been charged under Section 112 in 312 cases. Dr. Chambers is the first noncitizen to be charged under this provision during this period. He lectures on civil-military relations in Southeast Asia in northern Thailand.

On 9 April 2025, the Court of Appeal Region 6 overturned the lower court’s decision and granted bail to Dr. Chambers on a surety of THB 300,000 (approx. USD 9,000), subjected to the condition that he wear an electronic monitoring device at all times, that he not leave Thailand without the court’s approval, that a guarantor be appointed, and that his passport be confiscated.
However, due to the revocation of his visa by the Commissioner of the Immigration Bureau, Dr. Chambers was subsequently detained by immigration officers and transferred to Phitsanulok Immigration. At approximately around 12:40 AM on 10 April 2025, he was released on bail by Phitsanulok Immigration on a surety of THB 300,000 (approx. USD 9,000), subjected to the condition that he report himself to Phitsanulok Immigration every 30 days. He was detained for nearly two full days.

"Authorities Ban Pro-Palestine Protest near US Embassy","Event Summary
On 19 March 2025, Jordanian authorities banned a peaceful protest planned near the US embassy in Amman. The pro-Palestine demonstration was organised by the informal group National Forum to Support Palestine Resistance. The protest had been properly notified to authorities in advance, but was nonetheless prohibited, marking a significant shift in the government&#8217;s response to ongoing pro-Palestine demonstrations. Since 7 October 2024, the group has organised dozens of similar rallies without incident, this is the first to be officially cancelled.
The ban suggests a potentially narrowing space for protest, particularly concerning sensitive topics. The ban raises concerns about the selective enforcement of Assembly Law No. 7 (2004), and Instructions Regulating Public Assemblies and Demonstrations (2011) and the potential chilling effect on civic activism and expression, especially regarding solidarity with Palestine.

"Government of Timor-Leste Allocates Civil Society Grants to Strengthen Governance and Community Development","Event Summary
On 15 April 2025, the Cabinet for Civil Society (GASC), under the office of Timor-Leste&#8217;s Deputy Prime Minister, announced the first list of 77 recipients in the &#8220;Religious Confessions and Congregations&#8221; category, selected to receive funding based on their submitted proposals. Further results for the &#8220;NGOs, Foundations, and Associations&#8221; category are expected by late April or early May 2025. This follows an open call for proposals issued by GASC in December 2024, inviting NGOs, CBOs, Foundations, Associations, and religious groups to apply for funding to support their strategic activities, such as construction, governance, and community training. GASC aims to ensure equitable access to funds, focusing on areas like civic education, governance, and institutional empowerment within Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) networks. GASC annually provides $6 million in grants to 145 civil society organizations. This initiative reflects ongoing support for strengthening civil society in Timor-Leste.

"Tension arises between the State and CSOs on the issue of freeway construction","Event Summary
In response to the planned construction of a freeway between Antananarivo and Toamasina, 107 civil society organisations (CSOs) in Madagascar issued a joint statement on 5 March 2025 demanding an environmental study before the project proceeds. The government countered with a communiqué asserting that necessary studies had already been conducted and criticising the CSOs&#8217; stance. Attempts to publish the CSO statement in newspapers were blocked, with one outlet, owned by a government-linked businessman, refusing publication. 
Following the statement’s release, CSOs leaders have reported facing surveillance, threats of arrest, and intimidation from authorities and the highway  contractor. This has created a very tense situation between CSOs and the governments

"Public Broadcasting of Courtroom Events in Section 112 Cases Banned","Event Summary
Since late March 2025, Thai Lawyers for Human Rights has noticed a troubling pattern of criminal courts banning public broadcasting of courtroom events in Section 112 cases (lèse-majesté crimes). Courts have stated that no person is allowed to broadcast events occurring in court. The unclear scope of this ban might lead to “contempt of court” prosecutions or fear of journalists to report the cases.
This order has been issued in at least 4 cases, even with different panels of judges: On 28 March 2025 at Arnon’s Nampa’s contempt of court hearing, on 2 April 2025, in the examination of evidence in the Section 112 case of &#8220;Tawan&#8221; Tantawan Tuatulanont, on 18 April 2025, in the examination of witnesses in the Section 112 case of Arnon Nampa, and on 22-23 April 2025, in the examination of witnesses in the Section 112 case of &#8220;Narin&#8221;.
In particular, the order affects the principle of “public trial” and the people’s right to scrutinize the exercise of judicial power, which ensures to the right to a fair trial. Although the court has the legal power to impose regulations or restrictions to maintain peace and order in the court area, such power must be exercised within the framework of appropriateness, proportionality, and must not unnecessarily affect the fundamental rights of the people.

"Arrest of protesters","Event Summary
On May 8, 2025, Gambian police arrested 27 individuals in Banjul during a peaceful protest organized by a group referred to as GALA. The demonstrators were calling for the publication of a comprehensive list of individuals involved in the acquisition of assets previously owned by former President Yahya Jammeh. These assets were seized following Jammeh&#8217;s departure from office in 2017 and were intended to be sold to recover funds for the state.
According to eyewitness accounts, the protest remained peaceful, with participants holding placards and chanting slogans demanding transparency and accountability in the asset disposal process. However, security personnel intervened, reportedly manhandling several protesters before arresting them. No use of tear gas or other crowd-control measures was reported during the incident.
The arrests have sparked criticism from human rights organizations and civil society actors, who view the government&#8217;s response as a suppression of free expression and assembly. Amnesty International and Transparency International have both called for the immediate release of the detained individuals and urged the Gambian government to uphold its commitments to human rights and democratic principles.
The protesters&#8217; demands are rooted in concerns over a 2025 investigative report by journalist Mustapha K. Darboe, published in The Republic, which revealed that the government could not account for approximately $375,760 generated from the sale of Jammeh&#8217;s assets. The report highlighted missing records and a lack of transparency in the asset disposal process, raising concerns about potential mismanagement and corruption.
This incident underscores the ongoing challenges Gambia faces in its democratic transition and efforts to promote accountability. The government&#8217;s response to peaceful protests and calls for transparency will be a critical indicator of its commitment to upholding human rights and the rule of law.

"Union Leaders Face Violence and Intimidation from Organized Crime","Event Summary
Through a public statement, the Federation of Civil Construction Workers of Peru (FTCCP) and the General Confederation of Workers of Peru (CGTP) denounced attacks involving explosive devices directed at their Secretary General and provincial union leaders. These incidents take place in a broader context of rising criminal activity in the country.
To date, 26 union leaders affiliated with FTCCP have been murdered in various regions of Peru, in acts carried out by hired assassins linked to criminal organizations. In response, the union has called on the Ministry of the Interior, the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the Judiciary, and the National Police of Peru to fulfill their responsibilities and act decisively to dismantle these criminal networks, identify those responsible, and impose the appropriate legal sanctions.
Although FTCCP is a member of the multisectoral commission monitoring violence at construction sites &#8211; led by the Ministry of the Interior &#8211; the federation’s communications representative has stated that the results achieved so far have been insufficient, as attacks continue to occur with impunity.
The FTCCP’s statement was supported by various organizations and business associations, which warned that the attack may have been intended to intimidate union leaders. In response, the Ministry of Labor and Employment Promotion (MTPE) strongly condemned the violence and urged both the Ministry of the Interior and the National Police of Peru to take concrete and immediate action. The Ministry also called on civil society and democratic institutions to present a united front against such acts of aggression, which aim to instill fear within social organizations.

"Police harassment of civil society organizations","Event Summary
On 28 April 2025, the organization Cristosal denounced police harassment at its facilities during a press conference. This event focused on the presentation of the results of the visit to the country of the president of the U.S. organization Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, who represent 10 Venezuelan persons deported from the United States and detained in the Terrorism Confinement Center &#8220;CECOT&#8221; in El Salvador, under serious human rights concerns.
The police officials entered the organization´s facilities, recorded and took photographs of them, as well as the vehicles of the staff and media present at the conference. When the agents were questioned, they reportedly informed that they were verifying a &#8220;supposed demonstration in favor of Venezuelans [referring to the immigrants deported by the U.S. government to the CECOT on March, 2025 under the Alien Enemy Act]&#8221;, and a press conference&#8221;. They lacked of a court order for such a proceeding.
This would not be the only event of civil society organizations in which police officials show up to ask for information. This month it also happened during the press conference of the Roundtable Against Impunity in El Salvador (MECIES).

"Arrest of Critical Documentary Film Makers","Event Summary
On 29 April 2025, BBC Africa released the Blood Parliament documentary, an investigative piece exposing the deadly events of the 25 June 2024 anti-finance bill protests in Kenya. The film presents a record of the killings and alleges that members of the Kenyan security forces were responsible for shooting some protestors at Parliament. The exposé sparked mixed reactions: while the public and human rights groups demanded swift investigations, sections of the political class condemned the film and called for action against BBC Africa.
As a direct follow-up to the release, four filmmakers involved in the production were arrested on 3 May 2025 during a late-night raid at their studio in Karen, Nairobi. They were detained overnight at Muthaiga and Pangani police stations. The arrests triggered an outcry from artists, human rights groups, and civil society actors, who demanded their immediate release. The filmmakers were later released on anticipatory bail and ordered to appear before the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) on 21 May 2025.
This case underscores growing state hostility toward investigative journalism, freedom of expression, and the right to information. It is part of a wider trend of intimidation and retaliation against those documenting human rights violations linked to the 2024 anti-finance bill protests.

This Wednesday, May 7, a new protest took place in front of the National Congress to highlight the plight of retirees and demand a response from the National Government. In this context, Federal Police, Gendarmerie, and Prefecture forces clashed with protesters, protected by the so-called &#8220;anti-picket protocol,&#8221; which allows for the indiscriminate use of force to clear the streets (thus, protests should only take place on sidewalks). As a result of this confrontation (which included the use of pepper spray), there were arrests and injuries, including Father Paco, a leader of the NGO Grupo de Curas Option por los Pobres (Group of Priests, Option for the Poor).

"Court decision sets precedent for the protection of environmental defenders","Event Summary
On 23 April 2025, the Agro-Environmental Court of Bolivia granted precautionary measures in an environmental case surrounding the recent illegal killing of five jaguars, ordering protection measures for both the jaguar and its habitat and for environmental defenders. It also identified seven people who require enhanced protection because of their involvement in similar complaints and because wildlife trafficking is linked to international criminal networks, and included other defenders who come forward in the process. The case was filed on February 2025 by Congresswoman María René Álvarez in response to the illegal hunting of at least five jaguars in the San Matías Natural Area, Santa Cruz. The complaint points to an international poaching network linked to the Argentine Jorge Néstor Noya and the Spanish businessman Luis Villalba Ruiz, the latter wanted by the Bolivian justice system. Various civil society organizations and the Office of the Attorney General of the State and the Ministry of the Environment and Water (MMAyA) joined the application. Other state institutions, such as National Customs, the Armed Forces, and the Police contributed by presenting information related to their functions. However, the Vice Presidency of the State objected, questioning the competence of the Court and the legitimacy of Deputy Álvarez and requesting that the request for precautionary measured be declared inadmissible.
The decision of the Agro-Environmental Court includes provisions addressed to different State institutions, including the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the Bolivian Police, the Ministry of Justice and Transparency, the Ministry of Government, the Supreme Court of Justice. While their compliance is pending, the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office is preparing an appeal for complementation and amendment to clarify the deadlines for compliance.
The favorable decision of the Agro-Environmental Court sets an important precedent for environmental defense in Bolivia, applying the Escazú Agreement and the Bolivian Constitution, to guarantee their rights to life, integrity, free expression, participation and association, in the face of threats, harassment or improper use of public force. According to data from the Observatory of Rights Defenders of UNITAS, there have been 16 violations against environmental defenders in 2024.
The environmental action for precautionary measures carried out is novel in terms of strategic litigation. The resolution of the Agro-Environmental Tribunal generated a legal provision that, among others, establishes: prevention of attacks, threats and intimidation for environmental rights defenders; the preparation by the Office of the Ombudsman of a National Plan of Action for the recognition, protection and promotion of the rights of human rights defenders in environmental matters; the creation of a National Jaguar Conservation Fund to the Plurinational Legislative Assembly; the ecological pause for fires and clearings throughout the national territory or the ecological pause for extractive anthropic activities within national, departmental, municipal and indigenous protected areas. If properly implemented, this decision could be the beginning of a line of jurisprudence in Bolivia that allows the recommendations of international human rights organizations to be enforced, reinforcing the protection framework for environmental defenders and victims of ecological crimes.

"Protestas de maestros urbanos por ítems, incremento salarial y otros","Event Summary
Since April 21, 2025, urban teachers nationwide have been marching and blocking various cities in Bolivia, primarily in La Paz, the seat of government, demanding that the State increase the sector&#8217;s budget, allocate funding, level salaries, and provide pensions that reflect their salaries, among other demands.
The demonstrations have been most concentrated in La Paz, specifically at the Ministry of Education, where a column of hundreds of teachers arrived on April 21 to demand a response and attention from Minister Omar Veliz. A police cordon prevented the protesters from entering and approaching the offices [1] .
According to videos [2] and press reports, police used tear gas indiscriminately against the protesters, injuring at least two of them. According to the footage [3] , a man is approached by five police officers, tear gassed and physically assaulted while he tries to defend himself. He is later released.
According to the departmental commander of the La Paz Police, Gunther Agudo, two teachers were arrested because the protesters used firecrackers against the police [4] . A police officer, he said, was injured by the explosion of a firecracker.

"Exclusionary, anti-NGO discourses gain traction amidst controversies regarding gender policies","Event Summary
In the first days of May 2025, the head of the Paraguayan Congress, Basilio Nunez, announced that President Peña will veto the Law &#8220;That Creates Specialized Courts and Tribunals in Matters of Violence within the Family Group&#8220;. The draft law had been sanctioned by the Senate on 23 April 2025 and has been causing controversies between gender advocates, the Ministry of Women, and lawmakers. The original draft, passed by the Upper House in 2024, had focused on violence against women specifically and was widely supported by civil society actors working on gender-based violence. The subsequent revision carried out in the Chamber of Deputies changed the gender focus and diluted it to the broader term of &#8220;family violence&#8221;, excluding the specific focus that was intended to provide for speedier resolution of cases of gender-based violence and for specialized courts that are better capacitated to deal with processes of violence against women. As part of the controversies surrounding the law, drafters of the original bill were accused of being influenced by international NGOs and foreign agendas.
The reformulation of the bill is part of a broader trend of regressing women’s rights, such as the ongoing legal initiative to eliminate the Ministry of Women and merge it with the Ministry of Children and Adolescents and the National Secretariat for Youth into a newly created Ministry of the Family. Civil society organizations have criticized the move arguing that the creation of the Ministry of Women was in itself result of the struggle of organized women from across civil society and established important public policies regarding the inclusion and participation of women, including indigenous women.
Both legal initiatives threaten to undo recent progress made towards gender equality, the protection of women’s rights, and women’s access to participation in decision-making. The discourses used by lawmakers to reject the original draft of the law question the motivation of Senators who are advancing gender equality and reproduce harmful anti-NGO discourses painting gender equality as a foreign agenda. The vetoing of these legal initiatives would mean that the current drafts are rejected and need to be returned to Congress. While this would be a positive development, anti-NGO and anti-gender discourses continue to be present in Congress as well as the broader society.

"Government imposes new restrictions on the right to strike","Event Summary
On 21 May 2025, the Argentinian government passed decree 340/25 imposing restrictions on the right to strike in the sectors of transport, education, and health. Classifying these as essential activities, the decree obliges trade unions to guarantee a minimum of 50-75% of services to continue in the event of a strike. This means that strikes in these sectors are restricted to 25% of the activities. The decree was drafted for a specific activity of the Merchant Navy, but through one of its articles modifies Labor Reform Law 25,877, which covers all areas of work. The decree violates Article 14 of the National Consitution, ILO Convention No. 87, and the considerations of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights that limits the scope of so-called essential services, for which strike restrictions may be imposed. Education and transportation, with the exception of air traffic controllers, are therefore not considered essential services and such restrictions may be imposed on the right to strike in these sectors. The decree also violates Law 14.250 which established collective bargaining instruments and defines the processes by which the state my limit the constitutional right to strike. The restriction is therefore an illegitimate limitation of the fundamental rights of workers, particularly in transport, the public sector and education, affecting trade union organizations that have a long history in the country and are highly representative.
The decree follows previous attempts of the Argentinian government to limit the right to strike, which were dismissed by the National Labor Appeals Chamber in 2024. By including more activities as &#8220;essential&#8221; through the current decree, the exercise of the right to strike of more and more workers is limited, something that in the current context of economic crisis and undermining of purchasing power threatens the capacity of organized workers to act. Likewise, the violation of this decree threatens the trade union status of organizations, including the possibility of state interference or their dissolution.
In response to the decree, Argentinian unions, on behalf of the Association of State Workers, have filed a court injunction against the Executive Branch. The unions will also submit the complaint to the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association during its International Labour Conference No. 113, scheduled to start on 2 June 2025. If not halted, the decree risks a serious deterioration of the enabling environment in Argentina, particularly affecting freedoms of assembly and association.

"Enactment of new law which requires prior authorization for all foreign-funded civil society activities and projects","Event Summary
On April 14, President Dina Boluarte enacted Law 32301, which amends the Law Creating the Peruvian Agency for International Cooperation (APCI). The new law requires prior authorization from APCI for all civil society activities and projects that receive international cooperation funding.
Journalists and civil society representatives argue that, under the official justification of increasing transparency in the use of international cooperation funds, the law effectively turns APCI into a mechanism of political control over the activities of non-governmental organizations, including independent media outlets. These actors rely heavily on international support and have played a crucial role in exposing major corruption scandals in the country, such as the Lava Jato case and the “White Collars of the Port” network.
The Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR) has warned that requiring prior authorization to implement projects may create obstacles to civic space and the freedom of association by introducing new administrative requirements that could prove disproportionate. The Commission, therefore, urges the Peruvian State to review and align the law with the Inter-American human rights framework.
It has also been argued that the law is unconstitutional because it infringes on rights such as freedom of expression and access to information. The new legislation fails to guarantee fundamental journalistic principles, including professional secrecy and the ability to conduct investigations free from state oversight.
Finally, the law affects the right to access justice, particularly for low-income populations, by prohibiting organizations from representing rural communities—especially Indigenous peoples—since litigating or providing legal advice against the State constitutes grounds for sanction. This is especially concerning given that many organizations actively litigate cases involving State violations of rights.

"Survey shows low trust in institutions and hostility towards migrants","Event Summary
In late April 2025, the Center for Public Studies (CEP) published a national survey revealing a sharp decline in President Gabriel Boric’s approval rating—only 22% approve of his performance, while 66% disapprove. Simultaneously, 55% of respondents stated that conflicts between Chileans and immigrants are &#8220;very strong,&#8221; indicating growing societal tension. These figures coincide with a public interview by Chilean writer Marcelo Simonetti, who criticized Chile’s approach to migration as rooted in ignorance rather than curiosity. The convergence of low trust in institutions and increasing hostility toward migrants signals a deterioration of Chile’s civic and democratic environment, potentially undermining social cohesion and fundamental rights.
One of the most immediate threats is the potential normalization of exclusionary narratives in public discourse. If the perception that migrants are inherently linked to conflict continues to spread unchecked, this could lead to greater social polarization and a reduced willingness among the public to support inclusive policies. This shift in public sentiment could pressure elected officials to adopt more restrictive migration laws or to deprioritize human rights protections in favor of short-term political gains. In such a scenario, civil society organizations (CSOs) that work with migrant and refugee communities may face increasing public hostility, reduced access to public spaces, or even delegitimization in political debates.

"Executive decree undermines civil society role in Costa Rica’s SDG Agenda","Event Summary
On 2 April 2025, the president of Costa Rica issued Executive Decree No. 44945-PLAN-RE-MINAE, significantly altering the 2017 regulatory framework governing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Key provisions supporting civil society participation and funding were repealed, including Article 12, which ensured financial resources for SDG-related actions, and Article 15, which declared the SDGs a matter of public interest and legitimising civil society’s role.
The new decree narrows the SDG framework to 55 targets &#8220;adopted by the country,&#8221; removing the automatic commitment to the full 2030 Agenda. It emphasises alignment with national development priorities and constitutional values. While the government cited sovereignty and constitutional principles, such as Christian and moral values as justification, the intention behind the changes remains ambiguous.
Critically, civil society was excluded from the reform process. Despite the existence of an SDG Advisory Committee, neither it nor other stakeholders were consulted. This contravenes both the original 2017 decree, which mandates democratic dialogue and participation, and the General Law on Public Administration.
The reforms will undermine Costa Rica’s enabling environment for civil society. The loss of funding and public interest status weakens institutional support for civil society-led initiatives. Moreover, the failure to consult stakeholders undermine principles of transparency, participation, and state responsiveness

"Argentinian officials block civil society participation in MERCOSUR Institute for Public Policies on Human Rights","Event Summary
After 20 years of successful civil society participation in the human rights spaces of MERCOSUR, Argentinian officials have, for the first time, prevented civil society from participating in the 5 and 6 May 2025 meetings of the regional trade bloc. Having assumed Pro Tempore Presidency of MERCOSUR in 2025, Argentina has worked actively to hinder and ultimately boycott the space for civil society participation. According to the participating countries, the Argentine representative Úrsula Basset (in charge of the Human Rights Directorate of the Argentinian Foreign Ministry since March 2025) objected to all the topics proposed for the meeting, thus preventing – for the first time in 20 years of operation – the consensus necessary to work on a human rights agenda.
The meeting of High Authorities on Human Rights of MERCOSUR, moderated by the Institute of Public Policies on Human Rights (IPPDH), provides for the participation of representatives of civil society organizations as has been practiced for the past 20 years. In addition, civil society organizations and social movements in the region usually participate in biannual public consultations to share their analysis of the human rights situation, deepen relevant issues, and build regional advocacy proposals. The Public Consultations can be face-to-face and/or virtual and have been promoted jointly with the MERCOSUR Social Participation Unit. Thirteen public consultations on topics as diverse as human trafficking, LGBTIQ rights, and indigenous peoples&#8217; participation have been held since 2015. Both the participation of civil society in the meeting of High Authorities on Human Rights and the Public Consultation with civil society have been discontinued for the first time during the Pro Tempore MERCOSUR Presidency of Argentina that began in the first half of 2025.
The discontinuation indicates a breaking point in the consultation and participation of these civil society groups, hindering the development of public policies for the exercise of rights of marginalized groups such as LGBTIQ persons, disabled persons, and those facing discrimination and racism. The actions of the Argentinian officials reflect a systematic stance of the Milei administration against the elaboration of human rights policies, the participation of civil society in the construction of public policy in general, and a marked lack of interest in the construction of regional agreements. The event risks generating a paradigm shift on social participation in the framework of the regional integration process and constitutes a negative precedent generating a democratic deficit in MERCOSUR.

"National Assembly approves motion to develop a public participation bill","Event Summary
On 2 May 2025, the National Assembly of Lesotho approved a motion by the legislator for Mokhethoaneng constituency, Mokhothu Makhalanyane, to bring a Private Member’s Bill. This bill would pave the way for enactment of the Public Participation Act.
Currently, public participation in parliamentary decision-making is left to the discretion of parliamentary portfolio committees, which are given the power to determine whether or not to invite public participation on Bills through National Assembly Standing Order No 76. Public participation in governance thus remains superficial and tokenistic. For example,  CSOs were given less than 24 hours to prepare submissions for crucial national legislative reforms when the portfolio committee was dealing with the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill of 2024, limiting meaningful engagement. Parliamentary Portfolio committee’s Reports to the National Assembly on how bills were processed at committee level do not reflect CSO contributions, highlighting their exclusion from decision-making, according to advocate Mokitimi Tšosane, who is a former legal researcher at Transformation Resource Centre.
If passed, the Public Participation Bill will introduce legally binding procedures to ensure that citizens, civil society organizations, and other entities have a defined role in the legislative process. Enactment of this bill would therefore improve the enabling environment in Lesotho by creating a conducive environment for citizens, CSOs or any other entities to participate in the cultural life of the communities as understood under section 35 (1) of the Lesotho constitution, which provides that, “Lesotho shall endeavour and ensure that every citizen has an opportunity to participate in the cultural life of the community freely and to share in the benefits of scientific advancement and its application”.

"President announces recommendations from the Commission for Peace and Understanding to resolve Indigenous land issues","Event Summary
In June 2023, the government of Chile led by Gabriel Boric, installed the Commission for Peace and Understanding,  as it was promised in his presidential program. This organism finalized its work on 30 April 2025. It was meant to be a transversal instance whose purpose was to advise the President to build and consolidate long-term solutions to the territorial problem with the indigenous peoples in the regions of Biobío, La Araucanía, Los Ríos and Los Lagos. One of the objectives of the Commission was to promote a process of dialogue and agreements with the different sectors involved on the basis of a consolidated diagnosis, in order to arrive at a consensus that would socially and politically legitimize viable proposals to address the land conflict and the issue of reparations and establish a new relationship between the State of Chile and the Mapuche people. The results of the Commission were presented on 6 May to the President and on 22 May the measures that the government was going to implement based on the findings of the report were announced. This report contained 21 recommendations grouped into five main areas: 

Constitutional recognition: Proposal for a reform to recognise indigenous peoples in the Constitution.  
Land restitution: Creation of a new Reparation Agency with a fund estimated at 4,000 million dollars for the return of land. 
Comprehensive reparation: Implementation of a reparation law for all victims of violence, both Mapuche and non-Mapuche.
Territorial development: Proposals to foster economic and social development in affected regions.  
Implementation mechanisms: Establishment of a Peoples&#8217; Council and other institutions to ensure the implementation of recommendations.

The process itself involved the participation of more than 5,000 people, including Mapuche communities, farmers, foresters, productive associations and victims of rural violence. The report was approved by seven of the eight commissioners, reflecting broad consensus, though not unanimity. There is now a big legislative and program implementation to be carried on.

"Restrictions on freedom of assembly for an opposition party in Algiers","Event Summary
On 22 May 2025, the Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD), an Algerian opposition party, announced that it had been prevented by the administration of the wilaya of Algiers from holding a political meeting planned in Algiers. The event was scheduled for Saturday, May 24, from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., at the Ibn Khaldoun auditorium, a central venue in the capital. In a letter dated 21 May, the administration justified its refusal by indicating that the hall was not available due to other activities planned for 17 &#8211; 30 May. However, the RCD stressed that this was not an isolated case, highlighting a recurring pattern of denial of permission for its political rallies. In response, the party issued a public statement condemning the ban and filed an appeal with the administrative court to challenge the decision.
This incident reinforces the normalization of arbitrary restrictions on freedom of assembly and underscores the increasingly constraining environment for political expression and civic engagement in Algeria, where administrative barriers continue to limit the operational space of opposition parties and civil society organizations.

"Projet de loi relatif à la mobilisation générale adopté en Conseil des Ministres","Event Summary
Un projet de loi relatif à la mobilisation générale est actuellement en discussion à l’Assemblée Populaire Nationale (APN), après avoir été adopté le 20 avril 2025 en Conseil des ministres, présidé par le président de la République. Ce texte vise à mettre en œuvre l’article 99 de la Constitution algérienne de 2020, qui autorise la mobilisation générale en cas de menace grave contre la stabilité, l’indépendance ou l’intégrité territoriale du pays.
Lors de la présentation du projet devant les députés le 30 avril 2025, le ministre de la Justice a précisé qu’il s’inscrit dans une logique de « renforcement des capacités de défense de la nation » et de préparation à toute menace imminente.
Le projet comprend 69 articles. Il prévoit le passage des forces armées d’un état de paix à un état de guerre, et mobilise à cet effet non seulement l’armée, mais aussi les institutions de l’État, les entreprises publiques et l’ensemble de l’économie nationale. Les citoyens sont également concernés, avec une participation obligatoire à l’effort national. Des sanctions lourdes sont prévues en cas de non-respect des dispositions: des amendes pouvant atteindre un million de dinars, et des peines d’emprisonnement allant de deux mois à dix ans.
Le président de la République pourra décréter cette mobilisation en Conseil des ministres. Le chef du gouvernement sera chargé de coordonner sa mise en œuvre avec les ministères concernés, tandis que le ministre de la Défense activera le plan général de mobilisation.
Ce projet suscite de vives préoccupations au sein de la société civile, notamment en ce qui concerne ses impacts possibles sur les droits civils, la liberté d’association et l’espace civique, déjà fragilisé dans le contexte actuel.

"Arrests and More Interrogations of Family Members of Overseas Activists in Hong Kong","Event Summary
On 30 April 2025, Hong Kong’s national security police arrested and charged the father of Anna Kwok, a U.S.-based activist with a bounty on her head, for allegedly attempting to access her insurance policy valued at HK$110,000. He was later granted bail on 20 May. Anna Kwok’s brother was also arrested but released on bail. This marks the first known prosecution in Hong Kong for handling the assets of a person wanted under the National Security Law. Previously, authorities had limited their actions to questioning relatives without proceeding to arrest or prosecution.
Separately, on 8 May 2025, police questioned Joe Tay&#8217;s cousin and cousin’s wife. Joe Tay is another overseas activist and recent candidate for Canada’s Conservative Party. Tay also runs “HongKonger Station,” a social media platform focused on Hong Kong affairs and has a HK$1 million bounty on his head for alleged violations of the National Security Law. These events are part of a broader strategy to exert pressure on overseas pro-democracy activists by targeting their family members remaining back home.
This event signals a deepening deterioration of the enabling environment for civil society in Hong Kong. The use of national security laws to target the relatives of activists abroad represents a troubling trend that reveal an escalation in state repression. It raises serious concerns about collective punishment, intimidation tactics, and the erosion of basic legal protections for individuals not directly involved in political activism.

"Proposed amendment to the Trade Unions Ordinance to Restrict Offenders of the National Security Laws from Holding Union Positions","Event Summary
The Hong Kong government has introduced an amendment to the Trade Unions Ordinance aimed at ensuring national security. The proposed bill, which was submitted for first reading in the Legislative Council, seeks to prevent individuals convicted of violating national security laws from holding leadership positions within trade unions or initiating new union registrations. Under the current law, individuals convicted of crimes, such as fraud or membership in criminal organizations, face a five-year ban from union roles. However, the new proposal would impose a lifetime ban on individuals convicted of endangering national security from holding union positions. Secretary for Labour and Welfare stated that violating national security is far more serious than joining a criminal gang and that those convicted could be reintegrated into society, but they should not be allowed to hold leadership roles in unions. The bill would also make it impossible for such individuals to be exempted from the ban by special approval from the Chief Executive.

"Arrest of 22-year-old for social media posts with alleged seditious intent","Event Summary
A 22-year-old man has been charged for allegedly posting inciting content on social media platforms X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram. These posts, made between June 2024 and April 2025, are said to have the intention of inciting hatred or contempt toward the Chinese government&#8217;s political system as defined by the Chinese Constitution. The man faces charges of knowingly publishing materials with seditious intent. Police have yet to complete their investigation. The defendant has been denied bail and remains in custody pending further hearings, with the next court date scheduled for 12 June 2025. The prosecution has indicated that additional charges may be filed as the investigation progresses.
This arrest is a consequence of the National Security Law implemented in 2020 and comes amid a broader crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong, where pro-democracy activism and free speech have increasingly faced scrutiny from both local and mainland authorities.

"Continued Ban from Parliament and Persecution of Journalist Melvin Tejan Mansaray","Event Summary
On 12 May 2025, the Speaker of Parliament Hon. Sengepoh Solomon Thomas deferred the discussion of the findings of the report formally tabled by Parliamentary Committee on Ethics and Privileges concerning Melvin Tejan Mansaray, an investigative journalist and political commentator.  Although a motion had been moved to debate the committee’s findings, the Speaker cited a congested agenda. The matter is now expected to be debated in a future plenary session. This effectively prolonged the continued restrictions of Mansaray&#8217;s watchdog role on parliament, freedom of expression and access to information from parliament.
The report follows an investigation into Mansaray’s 2025 New Year’s interview on Radio Democracy 98.1 FM, during which he criticised Members of Parliament for failing to prioritise state accountability when they removed Auditor General Lara Taylor Pearce. These remarks were deemed by Parliament to be in contempt of the House and as undermining its integrity. In response, the Speaker imposed an indefinite ban on 13 January 2025 preventing Mansaray—a long-standing member of the Parliamentary Press Gallery—from entering the parliamentary precincts to cover parliamentary proceedings despite advice from Opposition Leader Hon. Abdul Kargbo to refer the matter to the Independent Media Commission (IMC).
During the committee hearing, Mansaray was urged to issue a public apology and retract his statements. However, he admitted to participating in the interview but defended his remarks as sincere concerns made in good faith, arguing that they were not meant to ridicule Parliament and insisted any perceived contempt was unintentional.
The Speaker’s actions have drawn criticism from several civil society actors, including the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists (SLAJ) and the African Parliamentary Press Network (APPN). These organisations argue that the Speaker’s decision constitutes an attack on press freedom and have urged him to pursue formal complaints through the IMC rather than impose punitive measures unilaterally.

"Radio Free Asia suspends staff and Burmese-language program due to Trump funding cuts","Event Summary
On 2 May 2025, Radio Free Asia (RFA) announced it would lay off over 280 staff members—around 90% of its US-based workforce—along with approximately 20 positions overseas. This decision was a result of President Trump&#8217;s executive decision to reduce funding for seven federal agencies, including the U.S Agency for Global Media (USAGM)— which oversees RFA, Voice of America (VOA), and several other media. Additionally, RFA stated that it will be shutting down several of its language services due to financial difficulties.
On 9 May 2025, RFA announced the permanent closure of its Myanmar-language program, which had been operating since 1997. The program covered significant moments in Burma&#8217;s history, including the 2007 &#8220;Saffron Revolution&#8221;, the 2010 to 2021 &#8220;democratic reforms&#8221;, and the 2021 attempted coup. For almost three decades, RFA has covered and exposed human rights abuses and served as an alternative to state media in countries where information is censored. On 29 May, the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) reported that almost 400 of RFA&#8217;s staff had been laid off.
This development represents a significant restriction in independent journalism and access to uncensored information, particularly in repressive media environments such as Myanmar. The closure of language services will severely limit the flow of independent information to communities that rely on external media for credible reporting. It also weakens the global infrastructure supporting civic space, particularly in contexts where local media is heavily censored or state-controlled.

"Mass Arrest of Journalists in Mogadishu","Event Summary
Between 22 and 24 May 2025, at least 15 journalists were arrested in Mogadishu as part of a crackdown on media freedom in Somalia’s capital. According to the Somali Journalists Syndicate, this wave of repression included arbitrary detentions, confiscation of equipment, and obstruction of media workers—primarily by officers from the National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA) and the Somali Police Force. The journalists, affiliated with both local and independent media outlets, were reportedly detained while covering politically sensitive topics, including governance, corruption, and national security. These arrests were carried out without warrants, and most of the detainees were held without formal charges or access to legal representation. Eyewitnesses and civil society organisations reported that security forces stormed several newsrooms and detained reporters on the spot. The National Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ) and other media watchdogs have condemned the arrests as unconstitutional and a clear violation of press freedom and human rights.
This event reflects a rapidly deteriorating civic space in Somalia, where freedom of expression, media independence, and democratic engagement are under threat. The coordinated crackdown sends a chilling message to journalists and civil society actors who play a vital role in promoting transparency and accountability. The use of state security forces to silence critical reporting undermines Principle 1 of the enabling environment for civil society—the protection of fundamental freedoms, particularly freedom of expression and access to information. It also raises concerns about the erosion of legal safeguards and the normalisation of arbitrary detention as a tool of repression.

"Co-hosting Press Statement with Opposition Risks Eroding Relations between Government and selected CSOs and Faith-Based Organisations","Event Summary
The participation of selected civil society organizations (CSOs) and Faith Based Organisations (FBOs) in a press briefing hosted with opposition political parties at Protea Hotel, Lusaka, on February 28, 2025, has endangered their public standing which in turn risks restricting their operating space going forward. This involvement is likely to attract restrictions on the enabling environment (EE) for these CSOs, as they may be perceived as agents of the opposition by the government. This perception could lead to strained CSO-government relations, negative public perceptions, and a politicized view of these CSOs, ultimately affecting their ability to operate freely and effectively in Zambia.
On February 28, 2025, opposition political parties, selected CSOs, and faith-based organizations (FBOs) held a press briefing at Protea Hotel, Lusaka, in response to disputes surrounding the recently launched 2022 Population and Housing Census Summary Report by the Zambia Statistics Agency (ZamStats). Opposition parties, including the Tonse Alliance, United Kwacha Alliance, Citizens First, and Socialist Party President Fred M’membe, accused the government of manipulating census data for political purposes. They highlighted evidence of State House&#8217;s involvement in the pre-publication scrutiny of the report and anomalies identified by top government officials, such as inconsistencies in figures from 15 wards in Southern Province compared to the 2021 voter registration data.
The controversy began on February 25, 2025, when Civil Service Commission Chairperson Dr. Choolwe Beyani publicly questioned the accuracy of the census data. The opposition framed the issue as an attempt by the government to manipulate demographic data for political gain, particularly in relation to voter registration and electoral boundary delimitation. The involvement of State House in reviewing the census report before its public release further fuelled concerns about transparency and accountability.

"Amendments to Peaceful Assembly Law Following Protests and Immediate Moratorium on Investigations","Event Summary
On 13 February 2025, the Prime Minister announced amendments to the Peaceful Assembly Act (PAA) with an immediate moratorium effectively halting the police investigations opened on 9 February 2025 against the so-called &#8220;SOSMA&#8221; hunger strike participants, referring to the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 under which individuals are held.
The events leading up to this announcement began on 8 and 9 February 2025, when Malaysian authorities violated the rights of 50 family members of detainees held under the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (SOSMA). During their peaceful hunger strike outside Sungai Buloh Prison, authorities imposed barbed wire barricades and heavy policing, forcing the protesters to demonstrate along a high-traffic main road, exposing them to significant safety risks. The family members were highlighting issues faced by their relatives in custody, including delayed trials. On 9 February 2025, the Prisons Department assured the family members of an appointment with the Home Ministry the next day. However, upon arrival, they were denied entry and forced to wait outside for 2.5 hours. Frustrated, they pushed past security officers into the complex and were only granted an audience with the Home Minister’s press secretary three hours after the scheduled appointment. No assurance was given regarding their demand for a Home Ministry visit to the detainees. Instead, the police on 12 February 2025 arrested Sevan Doraisamy, the Executive Director of SUARAM, a civil society organization involved in seeking the Home Minister&#8217;s audience, using Section 7 of the Protected Areas and Protected Places Act for unauthorized entry into the Home Ministry compound. The following day, SUARAM’s Programme Manager Azura Nasron and a family member, Durga Devi, were also questioned under the same provision. Despite clear video evidence of Sevan’s arrest, the police and Home Ministry denied the arrest, claiming he was merely “called in” for questioning. On 9 February 2025, the police opened an investigation under the PAA against the hunger strike participants. However, this was halted on 13 February 2025 when the Prime Minister announced the amendments and moratorium, highlighting the government&#8217;s response to the longstanding concerns over civic freedoms and police intimidation in Malaysia.
This decision came in response to the increasing weaponization of law and police intimidation to restrict civic freedoms in Malaysia. This development presents significant opportunities for improving the enabling environment for civil society, as the proposed amendment would remove the requirements for rally organisers to obtain permission from a venue owner.

"New criminal legislation could curtail rights","Event Summary
On 12 May 2025, Algeria&#8217;s National People&#8217;s Assembly (APN) adopted a new bill reforming the Code of Criminal Procedure. The bill was initially presented to Members of Parliament on 22 April 2025 by Minister of Justice Lotfi Boudjemaa. According to the Minister, the reform aims to simplify and modernize Algeria&#8217;s justice system by striking a balance between the State&#8217;s right to fight crime and the protection of rights and freedoms. He also claimed the bill aligns with international conventions ratified by Algeria and seeks to balance crime prevention with the protection of individual rights and freedoms. However, the bill has sparked significant criticism from legal professionals and civil society actors who argue that several provisions undermine constitutional guarantees and international human rights obligations. Specifically, they warn that the Bill creates an imbalance of power between the prosecution and defence, particularly by expanding the authority of the judicial police and public prosecutor at the expense of the rights of the accused and their legal counsel, promoting direct appearances which might increase pre-trial detentions, which erode the right to a fair trial. These changes threaten the right to a fair trial, as protected under Article 41 of the Algerian Constitution and Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Although the bill has passed the lower house, it must still be reviewed and approved by the Council of the Nation before it can enter into force. If enacted in its current form, the legislation could significantly narrow the space for civil society by weakening judicial safeguards and increasing the risk of politically motivated prosecutions.

"Sedition Sentence for Facebook Posts in Hong Kong","Event Summary
On 8 May 2025, Li Chun-kit, a 36-year-old bus technician in Hong Kong, was sentenced to one year in prison after pleading guilty to sedition charges under the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (Article 23). Between March 2024 and January 2025, Li published Facebook posts that criticized the police, judiciary, and government. His posts included derogatory terms to describe the judiciary and the police. The court found these posts to have seditious intent, and although the offense carries a maximum sentence of seven years, Chief Magistrate Victor So reduced Li’s sentence from 18 to 12 months due to his guilty plea. The sentencing of Li Chun-kit for Facebook posts that, while provocative, fall within the realm of political expression, reflects a shrinking tolerance for dissent and a growing climate of fear. The fact that the posts were non-violent and did not incite direct action, yet still resulted in imprisonment, reveal the disproportionate nature of the harsh legal response. This event also reinforces the chilling effect on public discourse and civic engagement, as individuals may increasingly self-censor to avoid prosecution.

"Final Grant Awards Announced: Expanded Support to Civil Society through GASC","Event Summary
On 7 May 2025, the Government of Timor-Leste, through the Office of Support to Civil Society (Gabinete de Apoio à Sociedade Civil – GASC), under the Deputy Prime Minister’s Office, announced the approval of 191 civil society organizations to receive public grants. The selected organizations—comprising NGOs, community-based organizations (CBOs), foundations, associations, and churches—were chosen through an open call for proposals. The grants will support a diverse range of activities, including infrastructure development, governance training, and other community-driven initiatives aligned with each organization’s strategic priorities. This marks a significant step forward in strengthening the sustainability of civil society in Timor-Leste. The transparent allocation of public funding to a diverse group of civil society actors demonstrates a tangible improvement in the enabling environment for civil society by enhancing the financial sustainability and operational capacity of civil society organizations. By institutionalizing a transparent and recurring grant mechanism, the government is helping to ensure that civil society actors have the financial means to carry out their missions effectively. Continued monitoring will be important to assess the inclusiveness, transparency, and long-term impact of this funding initiative.

"Supreme Court Allows Military Trials of Civilians: The May 9 Riots Case","Event Summary
On 9 May 2023, Pakistan witnessed a day of chaos that would go on to shape its legal and political discourse for years. Supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, enraged by his dramatic arrest, poured onto the streets. But this was not an ordinary protest. Within hours, the demonstrations turned violent. Iconic military installations, symbols of Pakistan’s armed forces including the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi and the Corps Commander’s House in Lahore came under attack. The visuals of civilians storming these high-security areas sent shockwaves through the nation.
In the aftermath, the state responded with an iron hand. Over 100 civilians accused of attacking military sites were swiftly booked. But instead of being tried in civilian courts, their cases were shifted to military courts under the Pakistan Army Act, 1952. This move reignited a long-standing debate in Pakistan, should civilians ever be tried in military courts?
Human rights groups, lawyers, and civil society raised alarms. They argued that military courts, shrouded in secrecy and lacking the due process of civilian judiciary, had no place in trying citizens. Their voices found support in the judiciary. In October 2023, the Supreme Court, through a landmark judgment, declared such military trials unconstitutional. For many, it was seen as a victory for civilian supremacy and rule of law.
But the story did not end there. The government, particularly the Ministry of Defence, challenged this ruling, emphasizing the gravity of the May 9 attacks. They argued that assaults on military installations threatened national security at its core, and therefore, warranted exceptional judicial measures.
On 7 May 2025, after months of hearings, a larger bench of the Supreme Court delivered its verdict. In a 5-2 majority decision, the court overturned its own previous ruling. It restored the contentious sections of the Pakistan Army Act, allowing the trial of civilians in military courts for offenses that target the armed forces and national security.
While granting this power back to military courts, the Supreme Court also gave a subtle reminder to the parliament. it urged lawmakers to consider amending the law to introduce an independent right of appeal for civilians convicted in military courts, a safeguard that could offer some balance between security imperatives and fundamental rights.
The decision has polarized opinion. Supporters see it as a necessary step to maintain the sanctity and security of military institutions in turbulent times. Critics, however, fear it signals a worrying tilt towards military overreach and a weakening of civilian judicial authority. For Pakistan, this case has become more than just a legal matter. It reflects the continuing struggle over the balance of power between civil institutions and the military; a theme that has defined much of the country’s history.

"Increasing Repression on Activities and Platforms of the Coalition of Families of the Disappeared","Event Summary
On 23 May 2025, the Collective of Families of the Disappeared in Algeria (CFDA) published a press release denouncing an intensification of attacks on its activities. The CFDA, which has been advocating since 1998 for truth and justice regarding enforced disappearances during Algeria&#8217;s civil conflict in the 1990s, reports a series of coordinated attacks aimed at silencing its work. Two recent events organised in Algiers were banned and physically blocked by the police. Two recent public events organized by the CFDA in Algiers were banned and forcibly disrupted by police forces. Simultaneously, the organization&#8217;s digital presence has come under siege: its online radio platform, Radio des Sans Voix, is now inaccessible; the Memorial to the Disappeared website has been destroyed; and the CFDA&#8217;s main website is blocked within Algeria. The CFDA views these actions as part of a broader effort to erase historical memory and suppress civil society&#8217;s role in truth-telling and documentation.

"Periodistas agredidos en protestas por la habilitación como candidato de Evo Morales","Event Summary
Seis periodistas, tres de ellos de medios internacionales y los otros tres de medios nacionales, resultaron heridos en la cobertura de una marcha de sectores afines al expresidente Evo Morales realizada el 16 de mayo de 2025 en la ciudad de La Paz, movilización que buscada la habilitación de éste como candidato a la presidencia para las elecciones nacionales del próximo 17 de agosto.
La agresión contra los seis periodistas se dio por parte de quienes marchaban y por la Policía, ésta última desplegada en inmediaciones del Tribunal Supremo Electoral, lugar donde se registraron los enfrentamientos. Los movilizados emplearon piedras y otros objetos para atacar a miembros de la Policía y éstos respondieron con gases lacrimógenos y con disparos de balines que impactaron a los reporteros.
De acuerdo con la Asociación de Corresponsales de la Prensa Internacional (ACPI), entre los tres corresponsales internacionales se encontraba un fotoperiodista, que recibió el disparo de un proyectil en el pecho y en el brazo; un videógrafo, que fue impactado por un balín en el pecho y un colaborador de una agencia de noticias asiática, a quien la Policía le roció gas pimienta en el rostro, que lo dejó aturdido hasta descompensarse.
Respecto a los tres periodistas nacionales, la Asociación Nacional de Periodistas de Bolivia (ANPB) precisó que fueron periodistas de las televisoras Unitel y Cadena A, además de un periodista freelance, que fueron atacados durante los enfrentamientos entre manifestantes y policías.
La Defensoría del Pueblo evidenció que &#8220;efectivos policiales hicieron uso indiscriminado de la fuerza, así como uso de agentes químicos para evitar el avance de los movilizados hacia el Tribunal Supremo Electoral&#8221;. Además, exhortó a la Policía a &#8220;racionalizar&#8221; el uso de la fuerza, más aún cuando en la marcha había personas mayores, con discapacidad y niñas y niños.

"Risque élevé de vote en catimini d’un projet de loi restrictif sur les associations et fondations","Event Summary
Le 9 avril 2025, le gouvernement béninois a transmis à l’Assemblée nationale un projet de loi relatif aux associations et fondations, sans consultation préalable des organisations de la société civile (OSC). Ce texte n&#8217;a pas été rendu publique et les organisations de la société civile craignent qu&#8217;il restreigne davantage l’espace civique. Le gouvernement évoque des objectifs de modernisation, de transparence et de gouvernance, mais aucune version officielle du texte n’a été rendue publique à ce jour. Les acteurs de la société civile craignent une rupture avec le cadre actuel basé sur la loi française du 1er juillet 1901 en prévoyant son abrogation, au profit d’un nouveau régime censé répondre aux « réalités nationales ». Ce manque total d&#8217;inclusion des acteurs concernés fait craindre un vote en procédure accélérée d’une loi contenant potentiellement des dispositions restrictives de l’espace civique.
En 2020-2021, un processus consultatif avec le gouvernement à propos de cette loi avait été initié avec le soutien financier de l’Union européenne dans le cadre du projet REPASOC, mais n&#8217;a malheureusement pas abouti.
Face à cette situation, GAPP Bénin, a interpellé le gouvernement et l’Assemblée nationale par courrier pour obtenir une copie du projet de loi. Aucune réponse officielle n’a été donnée à ce jour, et toutes les tentatives officieuses ont échoué. La délégation de l’Union européenne à Cotonou a été saisie.
Cette situation soulève des inquiétudes sérieuses quant à la volonté réelle de renforcer, plutôt que restreindre, l’espace civique au Bénin.
Malgré les difficultés liées à l’opacité du processus, les organisations de la société civile mutualisent les ressources et partagent  les informations. Il est souhaitable que la copie officielle du projet soit accessible au plus vite et qu’un dialogue constructif soit engagé entre les autorités et les organisations de la société civile.

"Arrest and detention of anti-corruption lawyer and human rights defender","Event Summary
On 18 May 2025, the Salvadoran authorities arrested Ruth Eleonora López, the head of the anti-corruption unit of the organisation Cristosal, on allegations of collaborating in the theft of funds from state coffers. Ruth has led denunciations of arbitrary acts and violations committed by the Salvadoran state, and was recognised by the BBC on its 2024 list of most influential women in the world.
The arrest of the lawyer and activist took place under serious irregularities, and during the first hours both her family and her legal representatives lacked information about her whereabouts, denouncing her forced disappearance.
In a statement by Cristosal, the arrest of Ruth López is not an isolated incident, but part of a systematic government strategy to silence critical voices, dismantle civil society and consolidate an authoritarian regime

"Approval of the Foreign Agents Law","Event Summary
On 21 May 2025, the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador approved a Foreign Agents Law. The new law requires individuals and organizations receiving funds from abroad to register with the Ministry of the Interior and pay a 30% tax on such contributions. It also prohibits these entities from engaging in political activities that could disrupt public order or threaten national stability. Penalties for noncompliance include fines of up to $250,000 and possible revocation of legal status.
The Foreign Agents Law poses a significant threat to freedom of expression and association in El Salvador, giving the government tools to control and punish organizations and media outlets that receive international support.
Organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have raised concerns, warning that the law grants the government broad discretionary powers to control and restrict the work of civil society groups and independent media. They criticize the vagueness of the legislation, which could be used to silence government critics.

"Acquittal of 11 Environmental Defenders Previously Convicted","Event Summary
On 22 April 2025, after more than a decade of legal proceedings, the Superior Court of Justice of Apurímac overturned the conviction of 11 human rights defenders and community leaders from the provinces of Cotabambas and Grau. The accused were acquitted of all criminal and civil charges stemming from their participation in the 2015 social protests against the Las Bambas mining project.
The defendants had originally been sentenced to prison terms of between eight and nine years and faced substantial civil reparations. However, the appeals process revealed a lack of sufficient evidence to support the accusations.
Many national and international organizations see this ruling as a significant precedent in the defense of the rights of communities affected by extractive projects. Institutions such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and Front Line Defenders acted as observers throughout the judicial process.
The acquittal reaffirms the legitimacy of the demands made by campesino communities and Indigenous peoples. It paves the way for renewed legal efforts to uphold collective rights in the face of powerful economic interests in the extractive sector.

"Use of force against student protesters at the National University of Huancavelica","Event Summary
Since 22 April 2025, students from the Faculty of Education Sciences at the National University of Huancavelica have been staging demonstrations and sit-ins to demand the resumption of construction on their new campus infrastructure. The public works project has been stalled for over a year due to issues identified in the soil studies.
On 5 May 2025, during one of the protests, clashes erupted when officers from the National Police’s Special Services Division intervened to disperse the demonstrators. The police employed tear gas, batons, and rubber bullets, resulting in multiple students injured and several individuals detained.
The following day, as authorities and students attempted to establish a dialogue table, police arrested one of the student leaders, accusing him of allegedly stealing a police officer’s cellphone during the security cordon. This detention, occurring at a critical moment in the negotiations, led to the suspension of dialogue until the leader’s release the next day.
The university issued an official statement condemning the use of violence during the protests, while students denounced acts of repression. Subsequently, on May 8, during a resumed dialogue session, an agreement was reached for the students to end their occupation of the university campus.

"Proposed laws threaten press freedom by increasing criminal penalties for defamation and slander","Event Summary
Peru’s Congress is set to hold a second vote on bills 4431/2022 and 6718/2023, with dates yet to be confirmed. These bills seek to increase criminal penalties for defamation and slander in cases linked to ongoing investigations of crimes by officials and public servants. In a joint statement, the Committee to Protect Journalists, the Inter American Press Association (IAPA), the National Society of Radio and Television of Peru, the Peruvian Press Council, and the National Association of Journalists of Peru (ANP) voiced serious concern that the bills if passed could severely restrict journalistic work and silence critical reporting. According to the Global Investigative Journalism Network, the proposed laws would prevent journalists from reporting on matters of public interest involving state officials. Such restrictions would represent a significant setback for freedom of expression and the public&#8217;s right to access information. 
The concerns extend beyond legislation. The Executive Branch recently attempted to impose mandatory informational segments across media platforms—a measure widely criticized as an effort to exert editorial control. In response to public backlash, the government suspended the proposal just days after its announcement. 
In addition, attacks against journalists in Peru continue to rise, often met with official silence. In at least two reported cases, journalists faced physical assaults, digital harassment, and intimidation, with victims directly accusing public officials of being responsible.

"Discurso de descalificación contra grupos sindicales y de educadores en huelga.","Event Summary



Durante la inauguración de una obra pública, el presidente de la República se refirió a la marcha de maestros y trabajadores de la construcción,  llevada a cabo el 4 de abril de 2025 en protesta contra de las reformas a la Caja de Seguro Social. En su discurso, el mandatario calificó a estos grupos de comunistas. 
Expresó lo siguiente:
«Que vayan a trabajar, y si no les gusta Panamá que se vayan para Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua o dondequiera, pero que no vengan aquí a pescar en la anarquía para cambiar un sistema que es democrático que nos interesa a todos».
«Ellos pescan en la anarquía y eso es lo que vienen haciendo fracaso tras fracaso porque lo de ayer fue gran fracaso a nivel nacional. Vi todas las fotos de estas benditas huelgas de todos estos comunistas y son ellos con ellos».
“Ellos conspiran con plata ajena y ya no van a tener plata”

"President warns to use 2/3 majority to amend the law to control local government councils","Event Summary
The local government elections in Sri Lanka were held on May 6, 2025. Although the National People&#8217;s Power (NPP) party emerged as the winner, it failed to secure over 51% of the votes in most electoral districts, achieving a majority in only three. This outcome opens the door for opposition parties to form alliances or coalitions that could collectively hold a majority of seats, thereby enabling them to take control of local government councils—unless the NPP is able to form similar coalitions.
On May 15, 2025, the President of Sri Lanka responded to this possibility by stating that if parties that did not individually win a majority attempt to gain control of local councils through coalitions, his government would use its two-thirds majority in Parliament to amend the law and prevent such coalition-led control.

"Use of excessive force against protesters","Event Summary
Since April 2025, Panama has experienced nationwide protests led by construction workers, teachers’ unions, Indigenous communities, and environmental groups. The protesters oppose a range of government decisions, including reforms to the Social Security Fund, the reopening of the Panama Copper Mine, construction of a reservoir in the Río Indio basin, and new defence agreements signed between President Mulino and the U.S. Secretary of Defense.
Police has responded with excessive force including widespread roadblocks and street closures, particularly in Indigenous territories. Reports have emerged of over 200 arrests, injuries, and allegations of police brutality, including excessive use of tear gas and arbitrary detentions—raising concerns about the criminalisation of protest.
This comes also after President Mulino publicly responded to the protests, particularly the 4 April demonstration by teachers and construction workers. In a controversial statement, he dismissed the protesters as communists, accusing them of “fishing in anarchy” and called the protests a “national failure.”
He also described the University of Panama as a “den of terrorists  following student-led protests and road closures. These remarks have drawn criticism for inflaming tensions and undermining the right to peaceful protest.

"Surveillance and Policing of Youth-Led Public Book Discussion at Independence Square","Event Summary
On 10 May 2025, youth groups Liga Mahasiswa Malaysia and the Federation of Malaysian Youth held a book reading and discussion event at the Independence Square in Kuala Lumpur. During the event, eight to ten enforcement officers—comprising five to seven plainclothed police personnel and three officers from Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL)—approached the group and began questioning the organisers. A senior officer from Dang Wangi’s Criminal Investigation Department asked if prior notice had been submitted to the district police chief, referring to the event as an “assembly”, and proceeded to question the organisers about the event’s purpose, the books being read, and the participants, including whether any were current university students. 
Organisers were told they could continue until 10.30pm but must then disperse. When asked to explain the legal basis, the officer did not respond directly, instead citing the group’s public event poster and number of social media followers. He explained that the group’s platform was routinely monitored, and that they came to the event to assess whether any “unpublicised elements” were being discussed. One representative was asked for identification for the officer&#8217;s internal report. 
Two to three days later, Dang Wangi police denied involvement, stating that their officers patrol the area in uniform and asserting that “there is no law prohibiting people from meeting friends and reading books in public spaces,” and that the event did not constitute a large-scale gathering that violated any regulation. DBKL defended its actions by citing by-laws requiring the mayor’s approval for all activities at Independence Square, and that events involving public assemblies must also secure police approval under the Local Government Act. It also emphasised that early applications are necessary given Dataran Merdeka’s iconic status, to “avoid future misunderstandings and ensure the smooth running of programmes.”

"Proyecto de Ley Antipiquetes en Córdoba: Riesgos para el derecho a la protesta social y el entorno habilitante","Event Summary
En mayo de 2025, autoridades de la provincia de Córdoba anunciaron su intención de impulsar un nuevo proyecto de ley para regular las manifestaciones públicas y limitar los cortes de calle, luego de que la Cámara de Acusación sobreseyera a seis dirigentes sindicales y sociales por una protesta realizada en abril de 2023. El Ministro de Seguridad provincial, Juan Pablo Quinteros, criticó abiertamente el fallo judicial, señalando que representaba un “retroceso” en el orden público y planteando la necesidad de establecer nuevos “límites tolerables” para la protesta.
Este proyecto de ley se enmarca en una tendencia nacional más amplia hacia la criminalización de la protesta social, reflejada también en la adopción del Protocolo para el Mantenimiento del Orden Público ante el Corte de Vías de Circulación (Resolución 943/2023) a nivel federal, y en el Decreto 340/2025 que amplía las actividades consideradas “esenciales” restringiendo el derecho de huelga.
Aunque la ley aún no ha sido aprobada, su avance legislativo genera preocupación entre organizaciones sociales, sindicales y de derechos humanos, quienes advierten que su adopción podría vulnerar derechos constitucionales como la libertad de expresión, reunión pacífica y petición a las autoridades. Además, señalan que podría consolidar un marco de represión sistemática hacia los movimientos sociales.
Organizaciones locales ya han manifestado su oposición al proyecto y anunciaron que, de aprobarse, recurrirán al Tribunal Superior de Justicia de la provincia, y eventualmente a la Corte Suprema de Justicia de la Nación, por considerar que se trata de una amenaza estructural al entorno habilitante en Argentina.

"Input from CSOs recognised in the recent Electoral Reform Technical Committee Report","Event Summary
On 5 June 2025, the Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ) publicly released the Electoral Reform Technical Committee (ERTC) Report, which includes key recommendations from Civil Society Organisations (CSOs). The ERTC was established to conduct a comprehensive review of Zambia’s legal and institutional electoral frameworks and to propose reforms. The report reflects input gathered through nationwide consultations with a broad range of stakeholders, including citizens, CSOs, political parties, the church, traditional leaders, and other interest groups. This publication represents a significant step toward enhancing transparency, inclusivity, and public engagement in Zambia’s electoral reform process.
By releasing the report publicly, the Electoral Commission of Zambia demonstrates a willingness to engage transparently with citizens and stakeholders. This move reinforces the principle of an Open and Responsive State, where public institutions make critical governance information accessible to the public. Secondly, civil society organizations (CSOs), especially those working in governance, human rights, and voter education, now have a credible, evidence-based tool to anchor their advocacy. The ERTC Report provides specific recommendations on improving electoral systems, increasing representation of marginalized groups, and reducing by-elections. On the policy front, the report’s recommendations, if taken seriously, could influence the amendment of electoral laws, constituency boundaries, and the conduct of future elections.

"Death of Zambia's Sixth Republic President Edgar Chagwa Lungu","Event Summary
On Thursday, 5th June 2025, it was officially announced that Zambia’s 6th Republican President, Edgar Chagwa Lungu, had died in South Africa while undergoing surgery. President Lungu governed Zambia from 2015 to 2021 before losing the presidency to the current Head of State, Hakainde Hichilema. After stepping back from politics briefly, he returned to the political scene in 2023 and signaled his intention to contest in the 2026 elections. However, the Constitutional Court ruled in 2024 that he was ineligible, having already served two terms as per the Zambian Constitution.
Despite the court ruling, Lungu remained a prominent and influential opposition figure and assumed leadership in a coalition of opposition parties. His death now creates a leadership vacuum within the opposition, with significant implications for political competition, public accountability, and checks on government power

"Presidential Remarks Fuel Mistrust Toward Civil Society and Undermine Democratic Space","Event Summary
On 2 June 2025, during Indonesia’s Pancasila Day celebrations, President-elect Prabowo Subianto made a speech accusing foreign powers of using civil society organizations (CSOs) to pit Indonesians against each other. He stated:
“With money, they fund CSOs to pit us against each other. They claim to be upholders of democracy, human rights, and press freedom—but that’s just their version.”
This narrative echoes previous statements made by Prabowo over the years, including in 2014 and at the Gerindra Party anniversary in February 2025, where he accused CSOs and media of being funded by foreign actors to manipulate public opinion. Coalitions of NGOs and human rights groups denounced the remarks as ahistorical and harmful, emphasizing the vital role of civil society in Indonesia’s democratic development.
National and international analysts expressed concern that these repeated accusations could erode public trust in civil society and legitimize future restrictions. NGOs have warned of rising “civilphobia” and “blind nationalism,” which not only endanger freedoms of expression and association but also risk alienating development partners.
Though no immediate legal changes have followed, these high-profile remarks signal an escalating shift in public discourse. Given past precedent in Indonesia—such as foreign agent laws being proposed under nationalist administrations—activists fear that institutional restrictions on civic space may follow.

"US Funding Suspension and its Impact on Civil Society","Event Summary
Following the decision by the United States government to suspend with immediate effect from the 24th of January 2025, all funding, contracts, programs and activities, civil society organisations (CSOs) in Botswana including Botswana Council of Non-Governmental Organisations (BOCONGO) members, have not been spared. This funding suspension has had a ripple effect, severely impacting critical services provided by CSOs in various sectors, including healthcare, education, social protection, and democratic governance. As a result, many organisations have not only been forced to halt service provision but have also had to lay off staff. Some CSOs currently have their programs and projects terminated, some which were suspended are operating under a 90-day waver which is about to end.
According to BOCONGO’s rapid assessment of the impact of the funding suspension, the most affected types of services include critical healthcare, such as HIV testing, prevention, and treatment, tuberculosis screening, and clinical responses to gender-based violence as well as social protection programs including emergency support for orphans and vulnerable children and legal and policy advocacy for LGBTQIA+ rights. Apart from these critical support programs for vulnerable populations, democratic strengthening initiatives have also been affected.
The funding freeze comes at a time where many of the donors and development partners who for many years have been sources of support for the sector, have shifted their focus to lower income and developing countries, whereas Botswana has been classified as an upper middle-income country. This status implies that Botswana as a country is able to fully resource its entire development without the support of such partners, including the important work done by civil society organizations. However, this is not the case in Botswana as civil society organizations are grappling with severe resource gaps, with many that are providing critical services such as child protection threatened with discontinuation of their services.

"Civil Society Engagement in Developing Regulations for the Public Benefit Organizations Act","Event Summary
The Kenyan government has extended the deadline for civil society organizations (CSOs) to formally register under the 2024 Public Benefit Organizations (PBO) Act  from 14 May 2025, to 13 May  2026, providing additional time for compliance and easing the transition from the repealed NGO Coordination Act of 1990. Alongside this extension, multi-stakeholder efforts are underway to finalize regulations to support the Act’s implementation. Harmonized draft regulations were completed between 14 and 26 May 2025, followed by stakeholder validation from 26 to 30 May. The draft was launched for public participation on 5 June, with civil society groups, including the Civic Freedom Forum, scheduled to consolidate feedback on 10 June. Nationwide public forums will take place from 19 June to 18 July, and a participation report will be submitted on 21 July. Feedback will be integrated by 25 July, and the final regulations validated and adopted from 28 to 31 July. The finalized regulations are expected to be launched on 1 August 2025, for submission to Parliament. This process reflects a collaborative spirit between government and civil society, creating a crucial opportunity for CSOs to engage, advocate for transparency, and monitor the implementation of the Act to safeguard civic space and accountability

"Conviction of the President of the Main Opposition Party and former President of the Republic, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner","Event Summary
On 10 June 2025, Argentina’s Supreme Court confirmed the sentence of six years in prison and permanent disqualification from holding public office against Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, former President of the Republic and current head of the country’s main opposition party. The decision was issued just one week after she publicly announced her legislative candidacy, and has been widely described by multiple actors as an act of political proscription.
The ruling stems from a highly controversial judicial case for alleged corruption in the awarding of public works  (“Causa Vialidad”) marked by numerous procedural irregularities, including the absence of conclusive evidence (as confirmed by expert reports), violations of due process, and the application of Article 280 of the Procedural Code—which allows extraordinary appeals to be dismissed without substantive review or legal justification.
The ruling triggered immediate reactions from trade union confederations CGT and CTA, social movements, human rights organizations, and political leaders, all denouncing its punitive and politically motivated nature. Demonstrations in defense of democracy took place spontaneously in several parts of the country, including protests in front of the Supreme Court.
Fernández de Kirchner’s legal team has initiated international legal actions. A submission has already been filed before the International Criminal Court in The Hague, and an additional appeal to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) has been announced, though not yet formally filed.
This event cannot be understood in isolation. It is part of a broader pattern of government actions that directly affect democratic memory and political opposition in Argentina. These include: the renaming of the Kirchner Cultural Center, removal of the name “Néstor Kirchner” from a national gas pipeline project, and the eviction and arrest of opposition figures at the Juan Domingo Perón Institute.
In light of these developments and the ongoing national election calendar, many sectors warn that this case sets a structural precedent threatening democratic environment and to the fundamental rights of political participation.

Autoridades originarias y líderes comunitarios del municipio de Viacha, en el departamento de La Paz, denuncian hostigamiento, amenazas de muerte y difamación【1】por su defensa del territorio frente a la contaminación minera. Juan Pablo Yujra, presidente del Organismo de Gestión de Cuenca (OGC) de la Microcuenca Pallina, y otros dirigentes como Alex Callisaya y Pastor Carvajal, han sido blanco de intimidaciones, incluyendo amenazas con armas y agresiones verbales.
Las amenazas escalaron tras la denuncia internacional realizada por Carvajal el 2 de mayo de 2025 durante el 24º período de sesiones del Foro Permanente para las Cuestiones Indígenas de la ONU【2】【3】, donde expuso la contaminación de ríos y acuíferos por 23 empresas mineras sin licencia ambiental en Viacha. Incluso fue amedrentado durante el evento por un dirigente sindical boliviano.
Además, los defensores son víctimas de una campaña de desprestigio en redes sociales【4】, acusados falsamente de corrupción o vínculos con las empresas mineras. Sin embargo, estudios de la Universidad Mayor de San Andrés y de la Empresa Municipal de Agua de Viacha【5】confirman la grave contaminación con cianuro, metales pesados y ácidos, afectando agua, tierra, ganado y salud comunitaria.
Aunque algunas empresas fueron clausuradas en 2024, los comunarios denuncian que siguen operando clandestinamente. También reclaman haber sido excluidos de los procesos de fiscalización oficiales. La OGC, que representa a nueve comunidades, exige atención real y protección frente al daño ambiental y las represalias por su labor de defensa del territorio.

Para el resumen de este evento se ha realizado una entrevista a la Licenciada Mayki Gorosito, Directora Ejecutiva del Museo Sitio de Memoria ESMA, despedida el pasado 4 de junio. La entrevista completa: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M-q_NupIj1O5uZHLP31yYDtMtuQCskJG/view?usp=sharing
El Gobierno Nacional, a través del Ministerio de Justicia, desplazó a Mayki Gorosito de su cargo como directora ejecutiva del Museo Sitio de Memoria ESMA. La medida generó un fuerte rechazo por parte de la asociación de sobrevivientes del ex centro clandestino de detención, quienes interpretaron el gesto como parte de una política de desmantelamiento en materia de derechos humanos.
Gorosito había asumido el cargo en abril de 2022. Su remoción se da en un contexto de recortes y reasignaciones impulsadas por el Ejecutivo en distintas áreas, incluida la de Memoria, Verdad y Justicia.
El ministro de Justicia, Mariano Cúneo Libarona, justificó la medida asegurando que &#8220;los espacios que antes eran destinados a programas ideológicos, ahora servirán en la lucha contra la inseguridad&#8221;, en línea con la reorientación de recursos que impulsa su cartera.

"Supreme Court ruling in favour of freedom of expression and freedom of the press","Event Summary
On 17 May 2025, the Supreme Court of Justice of Panama issued a landmark ruling in favour of freedom of expression and the press, in the context of a civil lawsuit brought against the newspaper Corporación La Prensa, S.A. The lawsuit, filed in 2006 by a former justice of the Supreme Court, sought USD 25 million in damages over three articles published by La Prensa.
In its decision, the Court adopted the &#8220;actual malice&#8221; standard established by the U.S. Supreme Court in the New York Times Co. v. Sullivan case. This doctrine holds that in order for public figures to succeed in civil defamation suits, they must prove that the contested statements were made with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth. Among other important points, the Panamanian Supreme Court also stated that compensation awards that merely aim to fulfil the plaintiffs’ dreams of fortune &#8211; by inflating the amounts disproportionately in order to silence those who are simply exercising their right to express themselves &#8211; cannot be allowed to prevail.
This decision marks a significant step forward for press freedom in Panama, contributing to a more enabling environment for independent media to hold power to account without fear of retaliation.

"Disinformation and Harassment Against Environmental Organization","Event Summary
International environmental organization Oceana, dedicated to ocean defense and conservation, is currently the target of a disinformation and harassment campaign in Peru. This campaign has included attacks on social media, publications in print media, biased reports on online platforms, and digital harassment by anonymous accounts and figures linked to ultraconservative sectors. According to reports from the journalistic outlet El Foco, these actions allegedly appear to be promoted by the National Fisheries Society (SNP), the leading business association of the Peruvian fishing sector.
The harassment began after Oceana filed a public interest lawsuit before the judiciary, questioning the legality of industrial fishing within Protected Natural Areas (ANP), specifically in the Paracas and Nasca Ridge marine reserves. The organization argues that allowing large-scale extractive activities in these areas seriously threatens marine biodiversity and violates international conservation commitments. As a result of this campaign, Oceana has reported receiving death threats against some of its staff, allegedly from criminal networks. In an official statement, the organization called on the Peruvian fishing industry to redirect the debate toward a technical, scientifically-based discussion, distancing itself from personal attacks, disinformation, and defamation—particularly in a national context marked by increasing violence and insecurity.
For its part, the National Fisheries Society, through its executive director, issued a statement on its website reaffirming its stance on the lawsuit and public criticisms, though it did not directly address the allegations of harassment or threats.

"The arbitrary arrest of an environmental journalist","Event Summary
According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF) sources, on May 16, 2025, Cambodian environmental journalist Ouk Mao, from the online news website Eagle News, was arrested by plainclothes military officers without a warrant. He was then taken to the military police headquarters in Stung Treng, a province in northeastern Cambodia. This arrest is part of a longstanding campaign of judicial persecution against him, as he faces fourteen charges, including defamation and incitement, primarily related to his reporting. Mao claims these charges are retaliation from local officials seeking to silence his work exposing environmental crimes. The journalist has consistently faced escalating harassment and threats while documenting illegal logging in the Prey Lang Wildlife Sanctuary.
On 25 May 2025, the provincial court mandated his release under specific conditions. However, charges and complaints against him are still ongoing.

On 27 May 2025, the Office of the Attorney General issued a non-indictment order in the lèse-majesté case against Dr. Paul Chambers, an American academic specializing in civil-military relations in Southeast Asia. Dr. Chambers was charged under Section 112 (lèse-majesté) of the Criminal Code and Section 14(1) of the Computer Crimes Act B.E. 2250 (2007), in connection with a blurb for a webinar organized by the ISEAS &#8211; Yusof Ishak Institute, a research center based in Singapore, about the Thai military reshuffles.
The non-indictment order from the Office of the Attorney General brings the criminal case against Dr. Chambers to a close, 54 days after the arrest warrant was first issued against Dr. Chambers on 31 March 2025.

"Presidential Primaries Amidst Growing Polarization in 2025 Electoral Cycle","Event Summary
Chile has entered a pivotal electoral period, with presidential primaries underway ahead of the general elections in November 2025. The political context is marked by the emergence of prominent candidates from both ends of the political spectrum, highlighting growing polarisation. This electoral cycle is also the first under the 2022 mandatory voting reform, which is expected to reshape turnout and voter engagement.
President Gabriel Boric’s administration, now entering its final stretch, has announced a mix of legislative initiatives, policy measures, and political positions -ranging from addressing the public security crisis and promoting social protections, to initiating debate on legal abortion, condemning Israel’s actions in Gaza, and proposing the transformation of Punta Peuco into a regular prison &#8211; aiming to consolidate its reformist agenda before handing over power in March 2026.
The convergence of an active primary season, the closing phase of a reform-driven government, and the backdrop of institutional changes positions Chile at a key turning point. This evolving context must be closely monitored, as it carries both risks and opportunities for Chile’s enabling environment. On one hand, the process is taking place within strong democratic institutions and encourages civic debate, pluralism, and electoral participation. However, the increasing visibility of polarised narratives and digital misinformation poses risks to public trust, social cohesion, and inclusive political discourse.
At the same time, this is also a moment of strategic opportunity. Civil society actors can engage in shaping political agendas, advocating for rights-based policies, and fostering inclusive debates on democracy, governance, and social justice. While the direction of these developments remains uncertain, the months ahead are critical for leveraging this pivotal transition to strengthen civil society participation.

"Raid on Himilo Somali TV reveals continued deterioration of press freedom","Event Summary
On 12 June 2025, armed agents from Somalia’s National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA) raided Himilo Somali TV, an independent media outlet based in Mogadishu. The raid followed the station’s broadcast of an interview with a young man who claimed he had been abducted and forcibly registered to vote.
According to two journalists who spoke with the Somali Journalists Syndicate (SJS), the incident occurred around 9:00 a.m. Fourteen armed NISA officers arrived at the Himilo Somali TV studio on Maka Al-Mukarama Road. Eight officers entered the building while six remained stationed outside at the gate. Journalists inside the studio reported that the armed agents caused panic among staff. In an effort to protect themselves, the journalists locked the doors. The agents demanded the removal of the interview report and searched for the journalist responsible, who was not present at the time. This represents a serious threat to the enabling environment for civil society, as it undermines press freedom, intimidates independent media, and discourages public discourse on electoral integrity.

"Severe Restrictions on Participation and Monitoring during 5 June 2025 Elections","Event Summary
The legislative and communal elections of 5 June 2025 took place in a climate of serious deterioration, marked by the intimidation of opponents, targeted violence against activists and numerous irregularities. Far from being a free and transparent democratic exercise, the elections were marred by alleged massive fraud, pressure on voters and blatant manipulation of electoral institutions. Several opposition parties were prevented from campaigning under fair conditions, while civil society and the independent media saw their operating space drastically restricted. Access to pluralist information was compromised by censorship and state propaganda. In this context, citizen participation was largely weakened, fuelling a deep sense of mistrust in the electoral process. Instead of strengthening democratic gains, this election marked a clear regression in political freedoms, institutional transparency and civic expression.

"Sri Lankan Government’s Continued Lack of Commitment to Participatory Governance","Event Summary
Sri Lanka’s commitment to transparent and participatory governance is being tested as the current  government continues to delay engagement with the Open Government Partnership (OGP) process. Although this criticism is targeted at the new administration, it is also underpinned by a longstanding pattern of neglect by previous governments, due to their failure to submit a National Action Plan for three consecutive years (2021, 2022, and 2023) pursuant to OGP standards.
As the deadline for submission of an Action Plan was 10 May 2025 , the co-conveners representing the civil society organizations (CSO) collective in the OGP process in Sri Lanka proactively reached out to the government in anticipation of a renewed commitment to restoring Sri Lanka’s active participation in the OGP. This readiness to re-engage was encouraged by the new government’s stated commitment to repealing legislation that restricts participatory governance and civil liberties.
However, despite repeated outreach by the co-conveners to initiate engagement, the relevant government entities &#8211; namely, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Presidential Secretariat, and the Parliamentary Caucus for the Open Parliament Initiative—have neither acknowledged nor provided any clarification regarding the government’s stance on re-engaging with the OGP process.
Furthermore, the formal communication sent by the OGP Headquarters in Washington to the Government of Sri Lanka in December 2024 has also gone unanswered. As a result, Sri Lanka has lost the crucial opportunity to restore its active status and retain its membership in the OGP.

"EU funds programme to support public participation in Lesotho","Event Summary
On 14 May 2025, the European Union Commission in Lesotho launched  “Inclusive Lesotho” as one of its new initiatives for 2025 by signing a partnership agreement with the government of Lesotho. The programme is aimed at enhancing participation and inclusion in the political system in Lesotho and strengthening the administration of elections. It will do this by strengthening civic education and empowering all citizens to fully participate in the democratic process; by supporting the establishment of an inclusive, accessible, and accurate voter registry; and by increasing transparency of electoral campaigns and party financing.
In a statement by the EU, Ambassador Paola Amadei is quoted as saying that the initiative draws on key recommendations from the 2022 EU Election Observation Mission (EOM). She added that the Inclusive Lesotho aims to strengthen electoral integrity, promote inclusive governance, and address long-standing structural barriers, in particular, strengthening the Independent Electoral Commission and civil society organisations as vehicles of civic education.
According to the 2022 EU Election Observation Mission report, by law, a political party registered with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has to facilitate the full participation of and ensure free and equal access for women, youth and disabled persons in political activities. However, the report shows that the IEC did not involve or consult Disabled People’s Organisations in the preparation of the elections, and had no specific provisions for inclusion of persons with disabilities in the electoral process, except tactile envelopes in some polling stations.

"Announcement of Constitution Amendment Bill without meaningful public consultation","Event Summary
On 23 May 2025, the Government of the Republic of Zambia, through the Secretary to the Cabinet, published a Government Gazette announcing its intention to amend the national Constitution by introducing the Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) Bill No. 7 of 2025. The proposed amendments include significant changes to the electoral system, such as increasing the number of constituency-based seats in the National Assembly, introducing a mixed-member proportional representation system to improve inclusion of women, youth, and persons with disabilities, and revising procedures related to by-elections and qualifications for office.
These proposed changes, introduced without prior public consultation, have raised alarm among civil society actors and legal experts, who have criticized the lack of transparency and citizen participation in the drafting process. The government&#8217;s one-sided announcement of the Constitution Amendment Bill without meaningful public consultation demonstrates a lack of transparency and accountability. This approach has the potential to erode trust, weaken legal safeguards and indicates a move away from participatory policy-making ultimately undermining inclusive, rights-based governance.
Public awareness campaigns on the Bill&#8217;s contents and possible long term consequences should be rolled out and inclusive national and provincial level dialogue forums should be facilitated to provide a platform for civil society, citizens, and policymakers to engage constructively on the Bill and the broader constitutional reform process.

"Increasing conflicts and harassment of electoral institutions threaten Bolivian electoral process","Event Summary
As Bolivia prepares for its national elections on 17 August 2025, the current electoral process reveals structural and emerging threats that seriously compromise the enabling environment for democratic participation and the exercise of fundamental rights.
The decisions of departmental constitutional chambers have repeatedly interfered with the functions of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE), weakening its technical and constitutional authority, as exemplified by rulings on the Third System Movement (MTS) and the disqualification of candidates. This has been described by TSE officials as &#8220;sabotage&#8221; of the electoral process that seeks to subordinate the electoral body&#8217;s decisions to judicial instances. At the same time, the Electoral Body faces a growing siege by political and social actors, including bomb threats, attacks and personal harassment of its members, which has led the TSE to request precautionary measures before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The attacks against the TSE create an environment of intimidation that puts at risk not only the integrity of its members, but also the autonomous and technical functioning of the electoral body. This type of political violence discourages citizen participation, particularly among historically excluded sectors such as women, indigenous peoples and youth, who may see their risk of reprisals for getting involved in public spaces or in defence of their rights worsened.
Added to this situation is a profound political and economic crisis, marked by the effective absence of the state in controlling violent blockades and confrontations, violating rights such as access to freedom of movement or access to health care, through attacks on ambulances and medical personnel, and putting constitutional stability at risk.
One of the most violent episodes to date has been the clashes on 10 June 2025 between pro-Morales blockaders and residents of the municipality of Llallagua, in the department of Potosí, which left dozens injured, looting and general chaos without a preventive police presence. On 11 June 2025, after a police contingent was sent to the scene, new clashes broke out, leaving three policemen and a 17-year-old boy dead, some of them with signs of torture. A central actor in this dynamic are the followers of former president Evo Morales, who, through blockades and violence, are seeking the resignation of current president Luis Arce, the qualification of their leader as a candidate in the next elections, and a solution to the economic crisis. This escalation marks a critical point in the current electoral process, highlighting not only the use of violence as a mechanism of political pressure, but also the ineffectiveness of the state to act promptly to protect the population, the authorities and democratic institutions.
In the medium and long term, this situation threatens to consolidate a hostile environment for the exercise of political and civil rights. Uncertainty over the validity of the TSE&#8217;s decisions may discourage electoral participation, generate citizen distrust in democratic processes and open the door to further post-electoral disputes, many of them potentially violent. The current developments are part of a consolidated pattern of institutional weakening, growing conflict, judicial instrumentalisation and lack of protection in the face of political violence, signaling further deterioration of the democratic environment and the structural risk faced by both the electoral process and the enabling environment for civil society.
Looking ahead to what is to come, the fourth Inter-Institutional and Multi-Party Summit for Democracy has established some particular and shared responsibilities for the different institutions to guarantee the holding of the elections on 17 August 2025, for example, the organs of public power, the Plurinational Constitutional Court, political organizations and all the actors of national life committed themselves to seek pacification &#8220;as a principle and as a path seeking dialogue and social peace.&#8221; The Executive Branch, within the framework of its constitutional powers and attributions, committed to guarantee &#8220;tranquility and citizen security&#8221; in the country. Regarding the resources for the elections, the Executive Branch committed to the provision of sufficient economic resources for the normal development of the electoral process and the Legislative Assembly to approve the &#8220;necessary and pertinent&#8221; laws to guarantee voting abroad.

"Tax Investigations Targeting Independent Media and Journalists in Hong Kong","Event Summary

The Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) revealed that since two years ago, the Inland Revenue Department has been reviewing the tax affairs of at least eight media organisations and 20 journalists or their family members. The authorities have demanded substantial provisional tax payments totalling approximately HK$1.7 million. Among those affected is HKJA Chairwoman Cheng Ka-yu, whose tax for the 2018/19 year was scrutinised. The department estimated her annual income at over HK$631,000, despite her actual salary at the time being HK$18,000 per month while employed in the investigative team of &#8220;HK01.&#8221; The estimated income was approximately HK$400,000 higher than her actual earnings. Cheng emphasized that her case is just one example of how journalists and media workers are also being subjected to what she described as &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; tax audits by the department. This event undermines the respect and protection of fundamental freedoms and a supportive legal and regulatory framework, as the reported pattern of disproportionate tax audits targeting journalists and media organisations is perceived as a form of intimidation. Such actions create a chilling effect on press freedom and weakening the role of independent media within civil society.

"Court confirms conviction of student who had called for blank vote","Event Summary
In May 2025, Hong Kong’s judiciary rejected an application by So Chun-fung, former president of the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Student Union, to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal. So had been convicted under Cap. 554 of the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance, which criminalises inciting others to boycott elections or cast blank votes by means of a public activity during the election period. His conviction stemmed from sharing a Facebook post by exiled former legislator Ted Hui, which encouraged voters to cast blank ballots during the 2021 Legislative Council election. So pleaded guilty to the charge of “inciting others not to vote or to cast invalid votes” and was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment, suspended for 18 months. After the High Court dismissed his initial appeal in March 2025, he sought to escalate the case to the top court, arguing that the law infringed on his rights to freedom of expression and political participation under the Basic Law. The Court of Final Appeal summarily rejected his application, with the judge citing national security concerns and the need to maintain political order during elections. This case marks one of the first definitive rulings upholding the legality of post-2019 legislative changes that criminalise calls for blank or protest voting. This event has significant implications for the respect and protection of fundamental freedoms for civil society, particularly freedom of expression. By upholding the conviction of So Chun-fung for sharing a social media post encouraging blank voting, the judiciary reinforces legal boundaries that restrict political expression, thereby narrowing the space for civil society actors to engage in open political discourse without fear of legal repercussions.

"Peasants eviction leads to unusual prosecution of mayor of municipality","Event Summary
A violent police eviction of 230 peasant families was carried out in the first week of June 2025, in Maracaná, Department of Canindeyú in the east of the country. In order to monitor the situation and verify the situation of families subject to eviction, the municipal mayor José Cantero was on site, accompanied by officials from the Council for the Rights of Children and Adolescents (CODENI), and as covered by the press. A few days later, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office ordered his arrest, accusing him of serious coercion, apology for crime and obstruction of criminal prosecution.
Various citizens&#8217; organisations in the district of Maracaná demonstrated the arrest of the municipal mayor ordered by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. It was reported in the media that the mayor, who is not part of the ruling party, had been at the site of the operation at the request of the Ministry of the Interior itself. Mayor Cantero indicated that it was his obligation to take cognizance of the situation of the people affected, as well as the private lands that are object of an expropriation project that has been in Congress without resolution since 2023. Civil associations mobilised to accompany Mayor Cantero in his appearance before the judge, who finally ordered his release on bail.
While forced eviction have been a recurrent incident in rural areas, the repression faced by an elected official who accompanied the monitoring of police operations, including actions ordered by the Public Prosecutor’s office, is highly unusual. The accusations lodged against the municipal mayor in response to his presence in the area contribute to the increasing criminalisation of expressions of social demands and civic demonstrations. This form of repression thus negatively affects the relationship between civil society and public representatives, threatening channels of dialogue and accompaniment.&#8221;

"Arrest of Digital Activist Raises Concerns Amid Ojwang Murder Case Development","Event Summary
On 30 May 2025, software developer and digital activist, Rose Njeri was arrested and detained in Kenya after developing a digital platform allowing citizens to send automatic emails to Members of Parliament opposing the Finance Bill 2025.  On 2 June 2025, she was charged under Section 16 of Kenya&#8217;s Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act for &#8220;unauthorized interference with a computer system,&#8221; and held incommunicado for four days at Pangani Police Station. Her arrest drew strong denunciations and vocal support from civil society, tech communities, and political actors, consequently she was released on bond on 4 June 2025.
Concurrently, in early June 2025, 31-year-old Kenyan blogger and teacher, Albert Ojwang, died in police custody under suspicious circumstances. Ojwang was arrested in Homa Bay County, Kenya, after he made a number of social media posts critical of Eliud Lagat, Kenya&#8217;s Deputy Inspector General of Police, accusing him of corruption. When police initially reported the incident, they stated that Ojwang had died as a result of self-inflicted head injuries after he hit his head on the wall of the detention cell. However, a postmortem and examination by a team of pathologists revealed a substantial amount of head trauma, neck compression, and multiple other injuries indicative of blunt force, resulting in the nature of Ojwang&#8217;s death being amended to homicide. Ojwang&#8217;s death resulted in protests across the country, especially in Nairobi, where demonstrators clashed with the police.
These incidents suggest an alarming trend of the state infringing upon fundamental rights in Kenya. Together, Njeri and Ojwang demonstrate a climate of fear for those involved in civic activism and actors engaged in digital dissent, and reveal the dire need for accountability, legal reform, and protection of civic actors to preserve the rule of law and public trust.

"Suspension of constitutional guarantees and internet access in the province of Bocas del Toro","Event Summary
On 20 June 2025, after acts of vandalism were reported in Bocas del Toro, the Cabinet Council declared a state of emergency and the suspension of constitutional guarantees in the province of Bocas del Toro, through Decree No. 27 of 20 June 2025. Subsequently, the National Public Services Authority (ASEP) temporarily suspended public mobile phone and internet services in the province. Currently, the province of Bocas del Toro remains isolated, so the names of those arrested during the police operation remain unknown. People whose family members have been detained are unable to communicate with national human rights organizations.
On 22 June 2025, provincial lawyers filed habeas corpus petitions on behalf of 74 detainees held in the Chiriquí Provincial Penitentiary Center under orders from the General Directorate of the Penitentiary System.
The suspension was decreed for a period of five days but could be extended for an additional five days. This situation creates serious risks of human rights violations and possible abuses by law enforcement.

"Youth protests lead to new government","Event Summary
On 3 June 2025, Mongolian Prime Minister L. Oyun-Erdene resigned after losing a parliamentary vote of no confidence, prompted by weeks of youth-led protests centered on corruption and political elitism. The demonstrations, sparked by viral social media posts revealing the lavish lifestyle of Oyun-Erdene’s family, reflected growing frustration among young citizens over entrenched privilege and lack of accountability.
Despite attempts to defend his leadership, Oyun-Erdene&#8217;s coalition fractured under public pressure, and his warnings about threats to democratic stability failed to defuse the unrest. The movement, driven by younger generations, sustained its momentum despite counters to the protests.
On 12 June 2025, the State Great Khural confirmed G. Zandanshatar as Mongolia’s new Prime Minister. A seasoned public servant, Zandanshatar has pledged to stabilise the economy, improve livelihoods, and address pressing issues such as energy reliability. His administration has committed to reforms in public sector pay, pensions, and employment policy, emphasising transparency and professional management of social funds.
However, early indications suggest that the new administration will prioritize continuity rather than systemic change. At this stage, it remains unclear whether there will be changes that will result in large-scale reforms, new legislation, or constitutional amendments.

"Murder of young social media personality highlights gender-based violence and online vulnerability","Event Summary
The tragic death of Sana Yousaf, a 17-year-old Pakistani TikTok influencer, on June 2, 2025, has sparked widespread outrage and highlighted the persistent dangers faced by women in the public eye in Pakistan. she was born on June 2, 2008, in Upper Chitral, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, she was a first-year medical student and a prominent social media personality. She gained popularity for her content promoting traditional Chitrali culture, women&#8217;s rights, and educational awareness, amassing over 740,000 followers on TikTok and nearly 500,000 on Instagram. Her vibrant personality and advocacy resonated with Pakistan&#8217;s Gen Z audience.
On the evening of her 17th birthday, Sana was at her home in Islamabad&#8217;s Sector G-13/1 when she was approached by a person named Umar Hayat, also known as &#8220;Kaka.&#8221; According to reports, Hayat had been persistently contacting Sana, and after repeated rejections, he visited her home under the pretense of a guest. After a brief interaction, he shot her twice at close range, leading to her immediate death. Hayat fled the scene but was apprehended in Faisalabad within 24 hours. He confessed to the murder, citing repeated rejections as his motive.
The incident has been widely condemned by government officials, civil society, and the public. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi commended the swift action of law enforcement, while Islamabad Inspector General Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi described the suspect as a &#8220;cold-blooded murderer.&#8221; Women&#8217;s rights organizations, including the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW), highlighted the case as a reflection of the violence women face in a patriarchal society. Her death underscores the urgent need for systemic changes to protect women from such atrocities and to challenge societal norms that perpetuate gender-based violence.

"The Price of Protest in Balochistan","Event Summary
Aimal Baloch, a 17-year-old student who was forcibly disappeared from his home in Balochistan on May 23, 2025. According to his mother, Mah Jabeen, armed men in plain clothes raided their home around midnight, detained her son without presenting a warrant or legal notice, and forcibly took him to an unknown location all in front of the family.
Activists have linked Aimal’s disappearance to the activism of his sister, Fatima Baloch, who has been a vocal participant in peaceful protests and rallies for missing persons in Balochistan. This incident has drawn widespread condemnation from human rights organizations and activists, who view it as part of a broader pattern of enforced disappearances targeting Baloch students and activists.
The case of Aimal Baloch underscores the ongoing human rights concerns in Balochistan, where enforced disappearances have been a persistent issue. Organizations like the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) have documented numerous cases, advocating for justice and the safe return of the disappeared.
International human rights bodies, including Amnesty International, have called for impartial investigations into such cases and for holding those responsible accountable. The enforced disappearance of Aimal Baloch is a stark reminder of the challenges faced by the Baloch community in their pursuit of justice and human rights.

The environmental organization CooperAcción reported being the target of a disinformation campaign aimed at distorting its work in defense of human rights and the environment. According to the organization, the newspaper Perú21 published a story—both in its print and digital editions—that damaged its reputation by accusing it of anti-mining activism and of promoting campaigns against formal companies in the mining sector.
After unsuccessfully requesting a correction within 24 hours, CooperAcción issued a formal notarized letter demanding an immediate rectification. Although the outlet later updated the digital version of the article to mention the letter, it has not issued a correction. The organization received public support from journalists and civil society organizations.
In parallel, the Legal Defense Institute (IDL) responded to a report aired by the television program Contracorriente on Willax TV, which claimed that the Peruvian Agency for International Cooperation (APCI) had imposed a fine on the organization for allegedly diverting funds to a non-existent entity. IDL clarified that while it did receive a fine, it was not related to the diversion of funds, as suggested by the report.
The organization stated that APCI has raised no concerns about its budget execution. IDL considers the report&#8217;s claims to be false and announced it would take legal action should the misrepresentation persist. The accusation was later echoed in an opinion column published in the newspaper Expreso.
In response to this context, the Executive Secretary of the National Human Rights Coordinator (CNDDHH) expressed strong opposition to media campaigns promoted by outlets aligned with powerful interests that seek to discredit civil society organizations, particularly NGOs. She emphasized that institutions such as IDL have a well-established track record both nationally and internationally, and actively contribute to oversight and accountability processes. She also warned about the use of the APCI Law as a tool for political pressure.
For its part, the Coordinator of Foreign Entities for International Cooperation (COEECI) expressed concern over the dissemination of false, incomplete, or inaccurate information, which may harm the work and reputation of civil society organizations in the country.

"Agresión a periodistas durante cobertura de manifestaciones.","Event Summary



On 14 June 2025, after 40 days of protests and blockades in the province of Bocas del Toro, the national government decided to carry out a police operation to clear the roads.
Journalists and cameramen from three media outlets, who went to cover the event, were punched in the face by the people blocking the streets . They were also threatened with rocks and robbed of their equipment in an attempt to prevent them from continuing to film. Some of the protesters later returned the equipment to the cameramen.
The journalists were taken to a safe location by the National Aeronaval Service.
In a statement issued by journalistic associations on 16 June 2025, it is mentioned that during the first two weeks of June, several instances of intimidation and, in some cases, physical attacks against journalists have been reported throughout the country during coverage of protests by demonstrators.

"Arakan Army imposes travel ban on conscription-aged individuals","Event Summary
On 22 May 2025, the Arakan Army (AA) issued a statement declaring that individuals of conscription age—both men and women—are prohibited from leaving Arakan State until the emergency period caused by the ongoing conflict comes to an end. Since March 2025, men aged 18 to 45 and women aged 18 to 25 have been required to serve in the AA for a period of two years. The statement also noted that anyone caught attempting to transport individuals of conscription age out of the state will face prosecution under existing laws. According to the AA, the travel restrictions are intended to protect ethnic Rakhine people from the risks of arrest, imprisonment, or violence in areas controlled by the military junta. However, a local human rights activist argued that compelling individuals to undergo military training against their will constitutes a violation of their personal freedoms. The activist emphasised that human rights violations are not limited to acts of torture or killing—restrictions on freedom of movement and forced conscription also represent serious infringements. These measures indiscriminately restrict the mobility of all individuals within the affected age groups, including civil society actors. As a result, many CSO personnel and community leaders face significant barriers to operating beyond the confines of Arakan State, severely limiting their ability to engage in advocacy, deliver services, and participate in broader peacebuilding and human rights efforts. This further erodes the enabling environment for civil society and undermines its role in promoting democratic resilience and accountability.

"Revocation of status of trade union’s cooperative, arrest of leaders and raid appear to be retaliation for protests","Event Summary



Between 20 and 24 May 2025, the Panamanian government undertook a series of actions targeting activists affiliated with the National Single Union of Construction and Similar Workers (SUNTRACS). SUNTRACS leaders have been at the forefront of protests and strikes, which began on 28 April 2025, in opposition to the social security reform law. 
Key developments include:
20 May 2025: At a press conference held at the Presidency of the Republic, the Panamanian Autonomous Cooperative Institute (IPACOOP) announced the revocation of the legal status of the SUNTRACS Multiple Services Cooperative, RL. According to IPACOOP, this decision followed an audit—initiated in early 2022—that identified violations of financial regulations and anti-money laundering laws. The criminal proceedings against SUNTRACS are based on a complaint filed by more than 100 affected workers. The cooperative is led by the same individuals who head SUNTRACS.
21 May 2025: SUNTRACS Secretary General, Saúl Méndez, sought political asylum at the Bolivian embassy. On the same day, the Public Prosecutor’s Office issued arrest warrants for Méndez, Genaro López, and other SUNTRACS leaders on charges including aggravated fraud, money laundering, criminal association, forgery, and malfeasance. Authorities also raided SUNTRACS offices across Panama City and several provinces.
24 May 2025: A judge legalised the arrest of Genaro López. However, on 5 June 2025, the Court of Appeals overturned this decision, placing him under house arrest and imposing a travel ban.
These actions have been widely criticised as examples of &#8220;selective justice&#8221; and viewed as tools of political repression and intimidation tactics against union leaders leading the protests.

"Democracy Defender Joshua Wong charged with new national security offense designed to extend imprisonment","Event Summary
On 6 June 2025, jailed pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was charged with &#8220;conspiring to collude with foreign forces&#8221; under Hong Kong&#8217;s National Security Law. Wong, already serving a four-year and eight-month sentence for his role in the &#8220;Hong Kong 47&#8221; case, faces accusations of conspiring with exiled activist Nathan Law and others between July and November 2020 to request foreign sanctions against Hong Kong and China. The new charge, which carries a potential life sentence, appears strategically timed to prevent concurrent sentencing, effectively extending Wong&#8217;s imprisonment beyond his scheduled January 2027 release date. Wong appeared in court briefly and did not apply for bail, with the case adjourned until 8 August 2025. This development underscores the continued use of the National Security Law to suppress dissent and signals a further narrowing of the enabling environment for civil society in Hong Kong, where activism and international engagement are increasingly criminalised.
This precedent establishes that activists can face indefinite imprisonment through successive prosecutions, ensuring that prominent democracy figures remain behind bars regardless of their original sentences.

"League of Social Democrats activists convicted for unauthorized fundraising and poster display","Event Summary
Four Hong Kong activists from the League of Social Democrats (LSD) were convicted on 12 June 2025, for unauthorized fundraising and displaying posters without permits. LSD chairperson Chan Po-ying, vice-chairs Dickson Chau and Yu Wai-pan, and activist Lee Ying-chi were found guilty of 12 charges related to setting up street booths in Causeway Bay and Wan Chai between April and May 2023. They displayed blank black banners and distributed leaflets containing QR codes linking to donation platforms. Magistrate Minnie Wat fined Chan Po-ying HK$6,600, while the other three received fines ranging from HK$1,000 to HK$3,000. The magistrate ruled that the black banners constituted &#8220;posters&#8221; under the law and that the QR codes represented active fundraising despite the group&#8217;s bank account being suspended. This event reflects an increasingly restrictive legal environment for political expression in Hong Kong. While the individuals targeted are affiliated with a political party rather than civil society organizations, the use of administrative and legal measures to penalize peaceful advocacy and fundraising activities raises concerns about the potential spillover of such tactics into the broader civil society space.

"First Public Operation by Beijing’s National Security Office in Hong Kong Targets Alleged Foreign Collusion","Event Summary
On June 12, 2025, the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People&#8217;s Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (OSNS) conducted its first publicly known operation in Hong Kong, in partnership with the National Security Department (NSD) of the Hong Kong Police Force to investigate alleged collusion with foreign forces. The operation targeted six individuals and one organization allegedly involved in &#8220;collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security&#8221; between November 2020 and June 2024. Police searched the residences of the six suspects and an organization&#8217;s office in Kwai Chung, seizing bank documents and electronic devices. The suspects were interviewed and required to surrender their travel documents under court notices. The operation was conducted under the new subsidiary legislation that mandates government departments to provide &#8220;all necessary assistance&#8221; to Beijing&#8217;s national security office. No arrests or charges were announced, and authorities did not disclose the identities of the name of the organization involved.
This operation marks a significant development in the operational role of Beijing’s national security office in Hong Kong. The use of broad investigative powers without transparency or formal charges raises concerns about due process and signals a deepening integration of mainland security practices into Hong Kong’s legal and administrative framework. While the targets have not been publicly identified as civil society actors, the opaque nature of the operation and the sweeping scope of the National Security Law suggest a growing risk of spillover into civil society spaces, particularly for organizations engaged in international advocacy or fundraising.

"Legislative fast-tracking undermines civic participation in Mexico","Event Summary
During the extraordinary legislative session held from 23 June to 2 July 2025, Mexico’s legislative branch fast-tracked the approval of at least 22 high-impact institutional legislative initiatives. The package includes reforms related to telecommunications, security and intelligence, enforced disappearance, money laundering, wildlife protection, among others. The process has been widely criticised for its expedited nature, lack of substantive debate, and the exclusion of civil society participation, as well as disregard for recommendations from international organisations and journalists.
Although some groups, such as collectives of searching mothers, have managed to have their demands heard, these openings occur as a reaction to social pressure, rather than a genuine willingness by the authorities to engage.
The legislative period concluded with the adoption of new laws and reforms. One of the most controversial is the General Law of the National Public Security System, which establishes the “National Information System” and paves the way for the institutionalisation of mass surveillance. Along with the reforms to the National Guard Law, the Federal Telecommunications Law, and the General Population Law, this legislation creates a hypervigilant environment, representing a violation of privacy and a setback to fundamental freedoms. In addition, the reform of the Anti-Money Laundering Law imposes new burdens on CSOs by requiring the identification of final beneficiaries and applying a risk-based approach that could result in organisations being classified as vulnerable to terrorism or money laundering.
Civil society organisations have expressed concern that this package of laws constitutes a setback in terms of fundamental freedoms, privacy, institutional checks and balances, and democratic openness. It consolidates a more centralised form of government, institutionalises a state surveillance model, excludes civil society participation, and increases legal requirements for the operation of organisations, thereby affecting their sustainability and access to resources.

"Convictions of Writer Sansal and Journalist Gleizes Signal Deepening Repression and Criminalisation of Expression in Algeria","Event Summary
Two recent judicial convictions in Algeria have raised serious concerns about the deterioration of the enabling environment for civil society. On 1 July 2025, renowned Algerian writer, Boualem Sansal was sentenced on appeal to five years in prison for &#8220;undermining national unity&#8221;. The charge was based on Sansal&#8217;s remarks to a French media Frontières, where he claimed Algeria inherited a territory formerly belonging to Morocco under colonial rule.  Just days earlier, on 29 June 2025, French journalist Christophe Gleizes, a contributor to So Foot, was sentenced to seven years in prison on charges including “glorifying terrorism” and possessing materials deemed harmful to national interest.
These convictions appear to be politically motivated rather than grounded in legitimate legal reasoning. They reflect a broader pattern of repression in the aftermath of the dismantling of the Hirak movement, where freedom of expression and association are increasingly curtailed. Civil society actors, intellectuals, and journalists now face heightened risk of criminal prosecution under vague and arbitrarily applied laws, contributing to a climate of fear and self-censorship.

"Arbitrary Arrest of Social Media Activist Signals Deterioration of Enabling Environment","Event Summary
On 15 June 2025, Ts’olo “Tjekatjeka” Thakeli, a youth social media activist from Teyateyaneng in Berea District, was arbitrarily arrested by heavily armed police officers following his public criticism of the government of Lesotho. The previous day, Thakeli had posted a Facebook video highlighting urgent issues including youth unemployment, corruption at the Lesotho Electricity Company, and rising electricity costs affecting vulnerable communities. The police raided his home without a warrant or jurisdictional authority, detained him without informing him of any charges, interrogated him unlawfully, and confiscated his mobile phone without justification and released him.
Later that evening, despite a lack of criminal evidence, Thakeli was again arrested after posting another video criticising the government. He was held in detention for two nights under harsh winter conditions, deprived of basic necessities but he was still not charged until he was released on 17 June.  His arrest and treatment constitute serious violations of his constitutional and internationally protected rights to freedom of expression and protection from unlawful arrest and detention. The incident reflects a troubling pattern of state repression against human rights defenders and activists in Lesotho. The arbitrary nature of the arrest, the conditions of detention, and the targeting of a peaceful critic raise significant concerns about respect for human rights and rule of law in the country.
The arrest signals a deterioration of the enabling environment, as it is the first time under the current administration that a civic actor on a social media platform has faced such charges. The timing appears calculated to send a message to the youth to refrain from criticising the government. Thakeli has just appeared before the Magistrate’s Court in Teyateyaneng, charged with inciting public violence and disturbing national peace.

"Police brutality in wake of protests","Event Summary
Following the death of Albert Ojwang in police custody, protests  began on 17 June 2025 with demands for the immediate resignation and prosecution of the Deputy Inspector General, Eliud Langat, who later stepped down to enable Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) investigations to proceed.
However, as the protests reportedly turned violent, the police responded with live ammunition and tear gas. A viral video surfaced of an officer beating up and shooting an unarmed street vendor Boniface Kariuki who is currently in critical condition and in the Intensive Care Unit of Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi. Two police officers involved have been arrested, interdicted and are being held in custody while investigations are underway. In connection with Ojwang’s death, six people have been charged with murder including three police officers in the High Court in Kibera. All six people pleaded not guilty and currently are being held in custody without bail as investigations continue.
Both the general public and civil society organisations have strongly condemned these incidents of police brutality, citing them as evidence of systemic abuse and a breakdown in police accountability. The Ojwang case was not simply a catalyst for these protests, it had also been a continuation of grievances that had developed over the previous year during the June 2024 Finance Bill protests, over 39 civilians had been killed in protests and multiple detained in police custody had alarmed many and illustrated an ominous and growing impunity for law enforcement.

"UN High Commissioner for Human Rights call for the repeal of the Online Safety Act and  moratorium on enforcement of the Prevention of Terrorism Act in Sri Lanka","Event Summary
On 23 June 2025, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk visited Sri Lanka, engaging with key stakeholders including the President, the Chief Justice, government officials, political leaders, and civil society groups. His visit came at a time of growing concern over the country’s deteriorating civic space and rights-restricting legislation. At a media conference in Colombo, the High Commissioner called for the repeal of the Online Safety Act (OSA), citing its vague and overly broad provisions that threaten freedom of expression and digital rights. He also urged the government to impose a moratorium on the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and to expedite the review and release of long-term detainees held under the law without due process.
The visit signaled heightened international scrutiny of Sri Lanka’s ongoing legal and human rights challenges, particularly the chilling effects of the OSA and PTA on free speech, association, and civic activism, and the urgent need for the government to take concrete legislative action and foster a more open and rights-respecting environment.
For civil society and the media, this moment presents an opportunity to reclaim space and legitimacy. The potential repeal of the OSA would be especially impactful in restoring media freedom, reducing state censorship, and enabling more robust investigative journalism and rights-based advocacy. These actors, long constrained by repressive legal tools and surveillance, would gain renewed authority to participate in democratic processes and public discourse.

"News Websites Blocked in Jordan","Event Summary
On 14 May 2025, Jordanian authorities blocked 12 independent news websites, citing vague accusations of “media poison” and “attacks on national symbols.” The decision was issued without any detailed official announcement, and the affected websites were given no opportunity to appeal or seek review by an independent judicial body. The move has been widely viewed by civil society groups as linked to investigative reporting on the handling of Gaza aid and as a form of politically motivated censorship. Civil society organisations are calling for the immediate reversal of the ban, public disclosure of legal justifications, independent appeal mechanisms, and comprehensive reform of the 2023 Cybercrime Law to protect digital rights and press freedom.

"Reform of Adoption Law in Chile","Event Summary
Chile is undergoing a long-overdue legislative process to reform its adoption law, which has been in the works for more than 12 years. The reform aims to modernize the current system, placing the best interests of the child at the center of adoption proceedings and ensuring alignment with international human rights standards. Key updates include the improvement of judicial procedures, reducing waiting times, and broadening eligibility criteria to allow adoption by diverse family structures, including single individuals and same-sex couples.
This reform responds to growing social and institutional criticism over the rigidity and inefficiency of the current law, which often prolongs the stay of children in the care system, hindering their right to a permanent and loving family. Civil society organizations and international bodies like UNICEF have actively supported the reform, highlighting the urgent need to prioritize child welfare over bureaucratic barriers or moralistic filters. Also, LGBTQIA+ organisations have welcomed the reform that allows same-sex couples to have the same status as hetero ones. 
While the bill has seen the approval of the Congress it is still waiting its official promulgation, but this should happen in the following weeks. The reform represents a significant step toward a more inclusive, rights-based approach to adoption in Chile and reflects broader societal shifts toward recognizing diverse family models and ensuring timely protection of vulnerable children.

"High Court Condemns State Non-Compliance with Prisoner Rights","Event Summary
On 25 June 2025, the High Court in Port of Spain delivered a strongly worded ruling against the Government of Trinidad and Tobago for failing to carry out mandatory sentence reviews of two prisoners whose death sentences were commuted to life in the 1990s. Justice Westmin James found the State had effectively ignored decades of legal requirements to convene Mercy Committee reviews and provide resentencing opportunities, describing this as unconstitutional and “akin to raising a middle finger to the judiciary.” The judge declared that holding the men indefinitely without any review offended fundamental rights and human dignity. The court ordered immediate resentencing hearings and compensation for the breach. This ruling exposes a serious failure by the Executive to comply with court decisions and protect due process rights. The judgment has wide significance, as it affects not only the two prisoners but sets a precedent for other inmates awaiting reviews, and underscores that ignoring court orders threatens the rule of law.

"Consultation meeting with NGOs to foster dialogue on social inclusion","Event Summary
On 7 May 2025, Mauritius’ Minister of Social Integration, Social Security and National Solidarity, Ashok Kumar Subron, together with Junior Minister Kuvalayan Kugan Parapen, convened a national consultation with approximately 500 NGO representatives to deliberate on key social development priorities, including poverty alleviation, social inclusion, and economic empowerment.  The meeting marked a significant gesture of institutional engagement with civil society, highlighting the government’s recognition of NGOs as essential partners in identifying grassroots challenges, delivering services, and fostering innovation within communities. Minister Subron emphasized the critical role of social transfers in reducing poverty and income inequality, while calling on NGOs to help identify and articulate community-level priorities. He also introduced a proposal to establish a network of “Centres of Life” across the country—spaces envisioned to support youth in reconnecting with purpose, creativity, and community engagement.
This engagement has important implications for the enabling environment for civil society in Mauritius. It signals strengthening of government–civil society dialogue and a growing openness to participatory governance. The recognition of NGOs as co-creators of solutions may enhance their access to resources, data, and decision-making platforms. Initiatives like the “Centres of Life” could also provide new opportunities for youth-led civic engagement. However, as civil society becomes more embedded in state-led initiatives, it will be important to safeguard its independence and ensure that engagement does not compromise its advocacy role.

"Arrest of Lounis Saïdi and Suspension of the 7 July 2025 National Railway strike","Event Summary
On 5 July 2025, Lounis Saïdi, Secretary General of the National Federation of Rail Transport Workers (UGTA), was placed in provisional detention by Algerian authorities. His arrest occurred just days before the planned national strike scheduled for 7 July, which had been officially announced on 25 June. The strike aimed to protest violations of trade union rights, irregularities in retirement bonuses, discriminatory practices, and the lack of dialogue with state authorities. Following Saïdi&#8217;s detention, the federal office of the union declared the strike &#8220;null and illegal&#8221; on 6 July, citing procedural non-compliance under the law on collective disputes.
The arrest and subsequent suspension of the strike highlight ongoing tensions between trade unions and the state over the right to freedom of association and collective action. The detention of a union leader ahead of a lawful strike may have a chilling effect on civil society actors, signalling increased risks for those engaging in advocacy or dissent, and undermining trust in institutional mechanisms for dialogue and dispute resolution.

"Hong Kong passes law banning national security offenders from trade union leadership for life","Event Summary
On 25 June 2025, Hong Kong&#8217;s Legislative Council passed amendments to the Trade Unions Ordinance that impose lifetime bans on individuals convicted of national security offenses from forming or holding leadership positions within trade unions. The amendments also prohibit such individuals from registering new unions, with no possibility of exemption by the Chief Executive. For comparison, those convicted of fraud or criminal organization membership face only five-year bans. The new law requires unions to disclose financial contributions from foreign actors and grants authorities additional powers to reject union registrations on national security grounds. The amendments will take effect on 5 January 2026. Labour Minister Chris Sun stated the changes were necessary after trade unions were used as &#8220;cover&#8221; for activities endangering national security following the 2019 protests.
These measures have serious implications for the enabling environment for civil society, as they curtail participation, reduce transparency, and eliminate avenues for accountability. The disproportionate penalties compared to other offenses suggest a targeted effort to suppress dissent, undermining civic freedoms and weakening the role of trade unions as legitimate actors in public discourse and policy advocacy.

"Public Sector Workers Picket Ministry Over Salary Review Delays","Event Summary
On 2 July 2025, over 300 public sector workers in Swaziland staged a peaceful picket outside the Ministry of Public Service in Mbabane to protest continued delays in the release of the long-awaited Salary Review Report. The demonstration, organized by members of major public sector unions—including the Swaziland National Association of Teachers (SNAT), Swaziland Democratic Nurses Union (SWADNU), National Public Services and Allied Workers Union (NAPSAWU), and the Swaziland National Association of Government Accounting Personnel (SNAGAP)—was a coordinated show of solidarity following union consultations across the country. Despite police attempts to disrupt the action, workers maintained their presence throughout the day, underscoring their frustration and determination.
The picketing coincided with a Joint Negotiation Forum (JNF) held inside the Ministry, where union leaders formally rejected the government’s request for a three-month extension and a revised eight-week proposal. A compromise was eventually reached, with the government committing to finalize the report within six weeks and present it by 30 September. The unions await a formal response from the cabinet by 9 July, when a collective agreement is expected to be signed. This dual action—strategic negotiation paired with visible public pressure—demonstrates the unions’ resolve and tests the state’s willingness to engage transparently and responsively with civil society demands.
The picketing action serves as a direct test of the state&#8217;s openness to civic expression and responsiveness to public sector demands. The government&#8217;s handling of both the protest and the negotiation outcomes will indicate whether participatory engagement is genuinely valued or merely procedural.

"Hong Kong film distributor Ying e Chi relocates to Taiwan and organizes first HK Indie Short Film Award","Event Summary
Following the dissolution of Hong Kong documentary distributor Ying e Chi in 2023, artistic director Vincent Chui relocated to Taiwan and reorganized the platform under the same name. The newly reformed organization held its inaugural &#8220;HK Indie Short Film Award 2025&#8221; featuring 11 selected works screened across the United States, Canada, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. According to the organizers, the award was established due to &#8220;the suspension and budget cut of some important short film competitions in Hong Kong, as well as the invisible red line of the new film censorship rule&#8221; that may limit exposure for promising films. One notable withdrawal occurred when the film &#8220;A Single Spark A Little Blaze&#8221; was removed from screening after pressure was placed on its interviewee, former Hong Kong Journalists Association chairman Ronson Ron Chan. The screenings in Taipei took place from June 7-22, 2025, including award-winning works like &#8220;Black Sheep&#8221; (winner of Best Director at Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival) and &#8220;My Pen Is Blue,&#8221; which was screened in its complete, uncensored version for the first time.

"Decree limiting the right to strike declared unconstitutional by court","Event Summary
On 30 June 2025, Judge Moira Fullana, of the National Court of First Instance of Labour Nº3, declared unconstitutional articles 2 and 3 of the Decree of Necessity and Urgency (DNU) 340/2025, promoted by the National Executive Power. This final ruling reaffirms a previous injunction that had already suspended the decree for violations of fundamental rights.
Passed on 21 May 2025, decree 340/2025 imposed restrictions on the right to strike in the sectors of transport, education, and health, classifying these as essential activities that need to guarantee a minimum of 50-75% of services to continue in the event of a strike. The decree was criticized by Argentinian civil society and unions for violating freedoms of assembly and association.
In his decision, Judge Fullana argued that the decree violated article 99, section 3, of the National Constitution by usurping legislative powers in the full operation of Congress. He pointed out that, at the time the decree was issued, Congress was in ordinary sessions, invalidating the exceptionality required for this type of instrument.
The ruling not only formally invalidates the Decree of Necessity and Urgency, but also points out that the restrictions on the right to strike contained in articles 2 and 3 had a direct impact on freedom of association and the right to strike, protected by article 14 bis of the Constitution, ILO Convention 87, the American Convention on Human Rights (ACHR) and the Protocol of San Salvador (PISDEC). According to the court ruling, these provisions contradicted international standards on the matter, arbitrarily expanding the list of essential services.
The Executive Branch has not yet issued an official statement, but it is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court.

"Media Blackout by the Communications Authority of Kenya in the wake of the protests","Event Summary
On 25 June 2025, the Director General of the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA), ordered all television and radio stations not to broadcast live coverage of the protests happening nationwide to commemorate the anti-tax protests of 2024. The CA justified this order by indicating that live coverage would violate Article 33(2) and 34(1) of the Constitution of Kenya, as well as Section 461 of the Kenya Information and Communication Act of 1998, because it could incite violence. Non-compliance to this directive was threatened with license revocation or signal disabling. The broadcasting channels followed the directive, except for a few stations whom the CA and the police went into their premises to shut off the signals for these broadcasting companies.
A statement by civil society actors condemned this directive and warned of unconstitutional assault on media freedom. The High Court, on the same day, ordered restoration of broadcasting signals, taking the CA to task on its breach of Article 34. Following public outcry, the CA suspended the directive pending public pressure and court directive. This blackout happened against a backdrop of violent protests, which resulted in deaths, forced disappearances, rape, arrests, and many injuries, mostly due to police brutality, and human rights violations. At the very least, the impression is that the blackout was to obscure state-sanctioned violence.

"Recomendaciones del Examen Periódico Universal","
Event Summary



En el marco del cuarto ciclo del Examen Periódico Universal (EPU), realizado en enero de 2025 en Ginebra, Suiza, el Estado boliviano anotó[1] recomendaciones que afectan al ambiente habilitante para las organizaciones de la sociedad civil, en materia de libertad de asociación, libertad de expresión y acceso a la información.



Polonia, Irlanda, Países Bajos y Colombia recomendaron a Bolivia modificar o eliminar la Ley 351 de otorgación de personerías jurídicas y su Decreto Reglamentario 1597, por considerarlos restrictivos para las organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONG). Bolivia respondió que dicha normativa no es restrictiva y optó por “tomar nota” de estas recomendaciones, lo cual implica que no asumirá un compromiso formal de implementarlas[2].



Asimismo, el Estado boliviano aceptó cinco de las nueve recomendaciones que recibió por parte de países miembros de las Naciones Unidas en materia de libertad de prensa[3]. Entre las recomendaciones aceptadas están las de Canadá, Bélgica, Alemania, Eslovaquia y Liechtenstein, que instan a investigar agresiones contra periodistas o respetar la pluralidad de medios. Sin embargo, Bolivia no aceptó cuatro recomendaciones, entre ellas la creación de un mecanismo integral de protección para periodistas. En 2021, el Grupo Interdisciplinario de Expertos Independientes (GIEI) en 2021 también recomendó al Estado boliviano crear una “instancia no estatal” para brindar apoyo y asistencia jurídica a periodistas[4].



Por otro lado, Chequia y Rumania recomendaron al país aprobar una ley específica sobre el acceso a la información pública que se ajuste a normas internacionales. El Estado optó, también, por tomar nota de ambos criterios[5].



Miembros de la Coalición Nacional de Organizaciones de la Sociedad Civil sobre los Derechos Humanos para el EPU de Bolivia valoraron la aceptación de las 254 recomendaciones, pero expresaron su preocupación por aquellas que no fueron adoptadas. Lamentaron que el Gobierno no “haya proporcionado una justificación sustantiva al respecto”[6].

"Algeria adopts security legislation that threaten civic space","Event Summary
On July 8, 2025, the Council of the Nation unanimously adopted two major bills that significantly reshape the country&#8217;s security and legal landscape. The first, the General Mobilization Act , authorizes the armed forces to enter a state of war with presidential approval and mandates the compulsory participation of public institutions, businesses, and citizens. Non-compliance is criminalized, introducing severe penalties for refusal to cooperate. On the same day, the Council adopted a reform of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which expands the powers of the security services and the public prosecutor, particularly in cases related to state security. The reform also reinforces the use of pre-trial detention, raising concerns about due process and judicial oversight.
Together, these laws form a legislative duo that consolidates a framework of exception and establishes a new model of security and judicial governance widely regarded by civil society as repressive. Their adoption signals a shift toward a securitized state apparatus, creating a vulnerable context for civil society that warrants close monitoring, as these laws could be weaponized in the future to suppress dissent and restrict civic space. Civil society organizations issued this statement .
An in-depth legal analysis of the amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure, co-authored by various actors, is needed. Consideration should be given to additional advocacy actions (legal, diplomatic, media, etc.) and this mobilization should be integrated into the preparation of the shadow report for the mid-term review of Algeria&#8217;s Universal Periodic Review (UPR).

"Presidential Primaries and Democratic Transitions in Chile’s 2025 Electoral Cycle","Event Summary
As it was reported before, Chile is currently in an election year and, as such, the presidential campaign is underway. Specifically, the primary election took place the past Sunday, June 29, with only the ruling party (left-wing parties) fielding candidates on the ballot. The primary was contested by four candidates: Carolina Tohá (Partido por la Democracia), Gonzalo Winter (Frente Amplio), Jeannette Jara (Partido Comunista), and Jaime Mullet (Federación Regionalista Verde). The primary itself was voluntary and had a participation of 9,16% (1.420.435) of the total population that was able to vote (15.499.071): independents and people enrolled in the parties participating in the process. The winner of the primary was Jeannette Jara with 60,16% of the preferences, who secured plurality of votes and will now represent the entire government coalition in the first round of the general election scheduled for November 16, 2025.
The opposition parties, including the right-wing and far-right, did not hold formal primaries as a unified sector, this because primaries are a voluntary process parties can organise. There where several candidates from the center-right and the right wing sectors, but ultimately the decision to support Evelyn Matthei (UDI) from those political parties was decided internally, not by the popular vote. Other key figures include José Antonio Kast (Republican Party), Johannes Káiser (National Libertarian Party), far right candidates that didn’t want to hold primaries with the center-right sector as they believe they have too many differences to be a unified sector. Although they didn’t hold primaries, they continued to campaign individually. The outcome of the June 29 primary has shaped the electoral landscape: for the first time, a female Communist Party member will run as the left party’s unified presidential candidate, marking a significant political and symbolic moment in Chile’s democratic evolution. The results also signal a strong left-wing mobilization, setting up a polarized contest for the presidency in November. This updated scenario reinforces the centrality of institutional primaries in democratic participation, the relevance of political coalitions, and the increasing tension between traditional centrist forces and the growing extremes: the central-left candidate Carolina Tohá, representing a more moderate posture, got barely 28,7% of the votes, not even half of Jeanette Jara´s votes. It will likely influence not only the presidential race but also parliamentary dynamics and civil society engagement in the coming months.

"Chile Approves Inclusive Adoption Law After Years of Civil Society Advocacy","Event Summary
After more than a decade of debate and civil society mobilisation, Chile’s Congress approved a long-awaited reform to its adoption law. The new legislation eliminates discrimination based on sexual orientation and marital status, shortens judicial procedures, and aligns national law with international child rights standards. This reform responds to growing social demands and criticism over the rigidity and inefficiency of the current law. More than 30 civil society organisations, international agencies, and academic institutions actively worked to push the reform forward. Among those participating in the parliamentary debate were groups defending children’s rights, LGBTQIA+ rights, minors in vulnerable situations, migrants, and religious representatives. While the bill has been approved by Congress, it is still awaiting official promulgation, expected in the coming weeks. Beyond the legal changes, the reform also reflects a major civil society effort acknowledged by legislators through participation and inclusion in legislative assemblies.

"Rabat Court Upholds Prison Sentence Against Journalist Mahdaoui, Raising Civil Society Concerns","Event Summary
On 30 June 2025, the Rabat Court of Appeal upheld an 18-month prison sentence, 1.5 million dirhams ($150,000) compensation against journalist Hamid Mahdaoui, following a defamation complaint filed by the Moroccan Minister of Justice. Mahdaoui, a licensed journalist with a significant YouTube following, had published a series of podcasts discussing alleged misconduct involving the Minister. The Minister filed five complaints, accusing him of defamation and invasion of privacy.
Despite the case falling under press and publishing activities, Mahdaoui was prosecuted for disseminating false accusations and facts with defamatory intent, public insult, and slander, under articles 443, 444, and 447 of the Moroccan Penal Code, a practice widely criticized by civil society and rights organizations as “heavy and unfair,” highlighting a broader trend of using criminal law to silence journalists
This case, along with others—such as the 2024 sentencing of journalist Taoujni to four years in prison—illustrates a restrictive legal environment that undermines freedom of expression and press freedom. Civil society views such prosecutions as a threat to independent journalism, access to information, and public participation, weakening the enabling environment for democratic accountability.

"Authorities Halt on Film Screenings at the 13th “Cinema and Human Rights” Festival in Rabat","Event Summary
On the night of 4 July 2025, authorities in Rabat, Morocco halted the screening of films scheduled as part of the 13th edition of the “Cinema and Human Rights” Festival organized by the Cultural Association for the Promotion of the Values of Human Rights and Citizenship, a civil society organization committed to raising awareness about human rights through cultural expression. According to official statement issued by the Association, all administrative and legal procedures required for the screenings had been duly followed. Despite this, the local authorities prohibited the event without prior notice or justification, raising concerns about arbitrary decision-making and lack of transparency.
The ban reflects a broader pattern of state interference that undermines the autonomy of civil society actors, particularly those engaged in rights-based work. It signals a restrictive environment where legal compliance does not guarantee protection from arbitrary censorship.

"New Algerian law expands use of death penalty in drug cases","Event Summary
On July 13, 2025, Algeria published in the Official Journal Law No. 25-03 of July 1, 2025, amending Law No. 04-18 on the prevention and repression of the illicit use and trafficking of narcotics. This new law introduces increased penalties for repeat offenses, including the death penalty for certain offenses, particularly if they result in death or a serious danger to public health.
Article 21 bis provides for the death penalty for crimes related to synthetic narcotics, while Article 27 increases prison sentences for repeat offenders. This legislative development represents a major step backward in light of Algeria&#8217;s international commitments, particularly following its vote in favor of a moratorium on the death penalty in December 2024 at the UN Human Rights Council.
This development is worrying because it runs counter to the global movement toward the abolition of the death penalty and reinforces an already heavy criminal arsenal, without any guarantee of respect for fair trial standards.

"Closure of UNHCR Office threatens survival of refugee protection organisations","Event Summary
On June 6, 2025, UNHCR announced that its national office in Trinidad and Tobago will permanently close by August 31, 2025, with public-facing services ending July 25, due to global funding shortfalls. This office has played a critical role in refugee protection and coordination, especially for Venezuelan asylum seekers, who make up 87% of the 22,000 registered refugees and asylum-seekers in the country. UNHCR’s presence has been the only mechanism for registration, Refugee Status Determination (RSD), documentation, and case management, operating in the absence of a national asylum framework. The closure means a withdrawal of funding, field coordination, and legal intervention, putting both local civil society organizations (CSOs) and refugees in a precarious situation.
The closure of UNHCR’s office in Trinidad and Tobago has significantly weakened the enabling environment for civil society, especially in the areas of sustainable resources, legal protection, and state responsiveness. While some organizations like the Caribbean Centre for Human Rights (CCHR) remain operational, others such as FPATT (Family Planning Association) have already lost UNHCR funding, affecting their ability to deliver services to refugees. The event also exposes significant governance gaps as the government has not engaged with CSO proposals, such as CCHR’s offer to manage refugee registration. This lack of responsiveness highlights long-standing reluctance to partner on refugee protection.
Local NGOs like the Caribbean Centre for Human Rights (CCHR) and La Casita Hispanic Cultural Centre have voiced concern about the protection gap left by UNHCR’s departure and stressed the need for urgent state coordination. UNHCR has stated that remote support will continue from its Panama office, with two outposted staff remaining locally.
At a June 5 cabinet briefing, Defence Minister Wayne Sturge said the government is considering a new migrant policy. La Casita’s director, Andreina Briceno Ventura-Brown, called the closure a “severe blow” that leaves major gaps in protection and psychosocial care, and urged the creation of a national registration and protection system. CCHR also confirmed its willingness to assume interim responsibilities if supported by the state

"Electoral Reform Discussions in Lebanon Raise Questions Ahead of 2026 Elections","Event Summary
Lebanon’s 2026 parliamentary elections face growing scrutiny amid renewed discussions on electoral law reform. Deputy Speaker Elias Bou Saab stated that the government has a one to two-month window to propose amendments, with expatriate voting emerging as a central issue. The debate centers on whether to retain six dedicated diaspora seats or allow the 225,114 registered expatriates to vote for all 128 seats in their home constituencies. While Speaker Nabih Berri has expressed reservations about full diaspora voting, 68 MPs from various blocs have voiced support for broader participation.
Technical and legal questions remain unresolved. The Ministry of Interior has confirmed that electronic voting cards cannot be introduced before 2026, and the feasibility of establishing mega-voting centers is unclear. Civil society organizations, including LADE and 16 diaspora groups, have launched coordinated campaigns such as #حقنابالـ128 and #diasporavote to advocate for expanded participation. These efforts are unfolding amid a notable increase in emigration and ongoing institutional debates. With only 11 months left until the 2026 parliamentary elections, and given the EU’s long-standing support to Lebanon’s electoral process, it is crucial for the government to resolve legal and administrative issues, such as diaspora voting mechanisms and the feasibility of mega-voting centers, without delay. The pressing need for clarity refers to the importance of finalizing decisions soon to ensure proper preparations for the elections.

"Civil society funding affected as Lebanon responds to EU High-Risk listing","Event Summary
On 10 June 2025, the European Union added Lebanon to its High-Risk Third Countries list under the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework, with the designation taking effect in July. This measure follows Lebanon’s grey-listing by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in October 2024 and requires all EU financial institutions to implement enhanced due diligence procedures for transactions involving Lebanese entities. The EU cited seven strategic deficiencies in Lebanon’s AML/CFT regime, including inadequate risk assessment mechanisms, weak supervisory structures, and insufficient transparency around beneficial ownership.
For civil society organizations, the designation introduces complex operational hurdles such as delayed transactions, rising banking costs, and additional compliance burdens. These include detailed documentation requirements and ongoing monitoring obligations, which may deter financial institutions from maintaining services. The timing of these restrictions poses challenges for NGOs operating during a period of sustained economic and social crisis, potentially impacting access to international funding and program continuity.

On 10 July 2025, the Moroccan government published Ministerial Decision, launching a subsidy program for associations, institutions, and companies to support the integration of the Amazigh language in public administration and digital transformation. This initiative follows sustained advocacy by civil society, notably the NGO Azetta Amazigh, and builds on a government fund established in 2023 to implement the official status of Amazigh.
Civil society has welcomed the move as a step toward participatory government, enabling organizations to access funding for language inclusion projects. While the quality of proposals remains to be seen, the initiative is expected to enhance linguistic rights, strengthen freedom of expression, and expand access to public services. It marks a significant shift toward institutionalising cultural rights.

"Closure of Paraguayan Institute of the Indigenous’ central office risks silencing indigenous peoples in national politics","Event Summary
In an official statement dated July 16, the Paraguayan Institute of the Indigenous (INDI), the governing body of public policy for indigenous peoples in the country, announced the closure of its offices in Asunción, the capital city, the legal domicile of the entity in accordance with current regulations. Instead, they reported on the opening of three regional offices, one in the Department of Caaguazú, already planned since 2024, and two in the Chaco region. The minister said that the measure adopted by directives received from President Santiago Peña, is part of a decentralization plan, with the aim of bringing the INDI closer to the communities.
Created in 1981, INDI is one of the institutions with the lowest budget. Taken together with the evictions of indigenous communities from their lands and the notable omission of indigenous peoples in President Peña’s annual report to Congress, this lack of attention to indigenous peoples’ needs adds to their marginalization, often resulting in indigenous peoples living in situations of extreme need.
The decision to close INDI was announced after hundreds of indigenous people remained for several days in front of the headquarters of the institution demanding for better service provision and for the dismissal of the president of INDI. When the closure of the central office was announced, police authorities simultaneously reported that the vast majority or protesters had already been transferred to their places of settlement.
Various indigenous organizations have since spoken out in rejection of the government’s decision to close INDI’s central office. ANIVID (National Indigenous Articulation for a Dignified Life) has called out the absence of clear and timely information to indigenous organizations and communities and proposes immediate reopening, compliance with Law 904/81, preservation of historical and administrative documents and establishment of channels of dialogue. The organization MIPy (Articulation of Indigenous Women of Paraguay) warns that the provision not only seeks to discourage the coming of indigenous people to the capital, but also to “make us invisible and silenced.”  The MAIPy (Indigenous Articulation Table of Paraguay) highlighted the fact that the decision was taken unilaterally and affects collective rights. Similarly, CONAMURI (Coordinator of Rural and Indigenous Women) denounced that the principle of consultation was not respected and that the so-called decentralization process rather means a suppression of the indigenous presence in public spaces in the country’s capital, the center of political and administrative power. The lack of communication channels for this decision has therefore caused great concern and mistrust among indigenous peoples organizations and raises questions about effective participation and attention to indigenous peoples’ issues

"""Cyberpatrol"" reforms to Federal Police Statutes threaten privacy and freedom of expression","Event Summary
The Argentinian government recently passed Decree 383/2025 and Resolution 828/2025, which authorizes the Argentine Federal Police (PFA) to carry out cyberpatrol tasks on social networks and public websites, carry out personal and vehicle searches, and detain people without a prior judicial warrant, in cases of well-founded suspicion or flagrancy, and for up to 10 hours. The decree and resolution were published on June 17, 2025 in the Official Gazette and are already in force. Its application is progressively implemented with immediate institutional impacts and structural effects on the way public security is exercised in digital and urban spaces. According to the authorities, these measures seek to strengthen the prevention and fight against complex federal crimes, inspired by models such as the FBI. However, human rights organizations, civil liberties specialists and various political sectors warned of serious implications for privacy, freedom of expression and judicial control, warning that the measure is implemented without legislative debate ( Página/12).
The new police powers erode constitutional guarantees, especially judicial control and the right to privacy and freedom of expression in digital environments. Human rights organizations (such as Amnesty International and HRW) have warned that the decree enables an &#8220;overloaded cyberpatrol&#8221; that can criminalize opinions or images on networks, as in previous cases during protests or quarantine. Civil society is affected by reduced protection from arbitrary detention, warrantless surveillance and digital intervention without effective levels of judicial control and transparency. In the future, the PFA could expand espionage practices and control of digital activism, affecting the legitimacy of public debate. The authorization of searches and detentions without judicial control leads to arbitrary detentions and deterrence of protest. The decree opens the door for the State to intervene in critical discourses without democratic filters. If not reversed, these measures consolidate a logic of punishment and political persecution under the cover of digital security, which crystallizes a serious institutional setback in terms of civil liberties.

The Government of Argentina, led by Javier Milei, filed a formal objection with the Organization of American States (OAS) to &#8220;dissociate&#8221; itself from the inclusion of the organization Catholics for the Right to Decide (CDD) in the 55th General Assembly held from June 25 to 27 in Antigua and Barbuda, alleging that its commitment to legal abortion violated the &#8220;right to life from conception&#8221;. Although the OAS is not obliged to accept this veto, the Argentine State used a footnote to express its rejection, generating complaints of censorship and harassment by CDD and other human rights organizations.
The government&#8217;s objection is part of a growing pattern of state restrictions against freedom of expression, diversity of voices and citizen participation in international spaces, as the OAS has pointed out with respect to the Argentine press. CDD, a feminist organization with more than 30 years of experience in defense of sexual and reproductive rights from a Catholic perspective, regularly participates in multilateral forums such as the OAS and the UN. Feminist and human rights organizations pointed out that the veto by the Argentine government constitutes an attempt to limit the plurality of voices in multilateral spaces and to impose ideological criteria in international forums, affecting the democratic participation of Argentine civil society. They have since met with UN Human Rights Representative in South America to express this concern.

"Lebanese journalists receive Criminal Investigation Bureau summons outside established legal procedures","Event Summary
On June 28, 2025, Lebanese journalists Carine Abdel Nour and Bechara Charbel were verbally summoned by the Criminal Investigation Bureau after publishing an article on alleged political interference in judicial appointments and corruption probes. The summons lacked proper legal documentation and violated due process under Lebanese law, raising concerns about press freedom.
Abdel Nour refused to appear, citing procedural irregularities, while Charbel complied and appeared before the Prosecutor General on July 2. Abdel Nour reported that this incident was part of a broader campaign targeting investigative journalism, including internal destabilisation at her newspaper Al-Hurra, economic and political pressure, and coordinated online harassment. The campaign led to the suspension of Al-Hurra’s print edition and threats to journalists’ employment.
The incident drew criticism from civil society actors including press organisations as well as from parliamentarians, who warned that such actions undermine the enabling environment for media freedom in Lebanon by eroding institutional safeguards and intimidating journalists.

"Criminalización y agresiones a defensor del medio ambiente","Event Summary
Jacobo Copa Mamani, an indigenous defender from Ayllu Cala Cala (Potosí), was the victim of attacks, kidnapping and criminalization after opposing the operations of the Mollepata mining cooperative in an area of high biodiversity and vital for his community&#8217;s access to water[1].
On June 25, Copa and other community members went to the Miriuri sector with a notice of precautionary measure to demand respect for the territory and water sources. However, they were attacked with dynamite and stones by mine workers. The next day, after trying to dialogue with the legal head of the cooperative, Gonzalo Aviza, they were attacked again. Copa was brutally beaten, lost teeth and consciousness after being reduced by a group of cooperative members.
Subsequently, he was handcuffed, put in a miners&#8217; truck and forcibly taken to the city of Potosí, where he was handed over to the police on false accusations of carrying drugs and a knife. Although these acts of criminalization were dismissed, Copa denounced new aggressions by police officers and did not receive medical attention or legal assistance, being later abandoned in a police office.
Olivia Portillo, an Ayllu authority, denounced that mining activity seriously threatens the community&#8217;s livestock, agriculture and fish farming, which depend on water from the head of the valley. The community has requested intervention from state authorities, without an effective response to date. Despite the violence and complaints, the mining cooperative continues to operate in the area.[2]

"Restrictions au travail des OSC par l’exigence de l’Avis de Non-Objection (ANO)","Event Summary
Since 2022, Malian authorities have systematically required a Notice of No Objection (NOO) for international and national non-governmental organizations (NGOs) wishing to implement projects in the country. This measure applies to all planned activities, regardless of their humanitarian, social, or development nature.
This mechanism, established to monitor and control the activities of associations and foundations in Mali, is fundamentally not governed by a clear legal basis or effective recourse, thus de facto giving the administration discretionary power to approve NGO initiatives. In many cases, ANO refusals are not justified, and response times are relatively longer and longer, which paralyzes the operational planning of organizations. The evaluation criteria remain opaque, and no official publication allows for monitoring of the decisions taken.
Several civil society actors, as well as international donors, have expressed concern about this obstacle to administrative oversight, which opens the door to political filtering of projects, particularly those related to governance, human rights, or public accountability. This situation weakens emergency humanitarian actions, limits local partnerships, and reinforces a climate of mistrust between the state and non-state actors.
This regulatory tightening constitutes a serious warning signal on the progressive restriction of the space for humanitarian and civic action in Mali in a logic of progressive shrinking of the civic space.

"Law Association of Zambia Petitions Against Zambian Cyber Laws","Event Summary
The Law Association of Zambia (LAZ) has taken a significant step by petitioning the Constitutional Court to challenge various provisions within the recently enacted Cyber Crimes and Cyber Laws. LAZ argues that these laws are unconstitutional because they infringe upon fundamental individual rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression, speech, conscience, association, the right to hold opinions, and freedom of the press. These rights are explicitly guaranteed by the Republican Constitution of Zambia. The legal action was initiated by LAZ President who asserts that the Cyber Laws contravene or are likely to contravene the rights of LAZ and its members as enshrined in Articles 17, 19, 20 (1), 20 (2), and 21 (1) of the Constitution. Mr. Zulu believes that numerous provisions within these laws are inconsistent with constitutional principles because they undermine essential freedoms as well as the right to privacy, and are not reasonably justifiable in a democratic society. This legal challenge highlights the ongoing tension between government legislation aimed at regulating the digital space and the imperative to protect civil liberties in a democratic society. The outcome of this petition is crucial as it could set a precedent for the protection of an enabling environment for civil society and individual rights in Zambia&#8217;s digital landscape. Furthermore, there was little to no consultation of CSO and other stakeholders before enacting the bill into law in April 2025

"LAZ Sues Speaker Over Bill 7 Ruling","Event Summary
On 9th July 2025 Speaker Nelly Mutti clarified that Bill 7 of 2025 can still proceed in Parliament if the Justice Minister chooses to advance it. Essentially, Speaker Mutti stated quite firmly that the Constitutional Court cannot actually stop this bill from moving forward in Parliament because it is already been introduced. She clarified that the court&#8217;s earlier ruling only applied to the bill&#8217;s process before it was submitted to Parliament, not its current status. However, despite the constitutional court’s ruling on 9th July, 2025 the Speaker of the National Assembly, Nelly Mutti issued a statement that sparked a new debate indicating that Bill 7 can still proceed in Parliament if the Justice Minister chooses to advance it and what the implications of the constitutional court’s ruling meant given the statement from the speaker. She firmly stressed Parliament&#8217;s independence once a law is in motion. CSOs and other stakeholders have continued to call for government’s action on the Bill to facilitate for wider consultations. The Law Association of Zambia (LAZ) took a step further  on 14th July 2025, and sued the speaker of the  National Assembly, Nelly Mutti over her ruling on the deferment of the Constitutional Amendment Bill No. 7 of 2025, describing it as unconstitutional. This is not just about the bill; it is about a bigger conversation in Zambia regarding how laws are made and the separation of powers and allowing the constitution to be “people driven” through vigorous consultation with stakeholders.

"Restriction de l’espace politique au Mali","Event Summary
Depuis mai 2024, les autorités de la transition au Mali ont entamé une restriction majeure de l’espace civique. Cela s’est matérialisé à travers, entre autres, la suspension des activités des partis politiques par décret n°2025-0318/PT-RM du 7 mai 2025, puis la dissolution de l’ensemble des partis politiques et organisations à caractère politique également par décret n° 2025-0339/PT-RM du 13 mai 2025. Ces décisions marquent une atteinte grave aux principes démocratiques et au pluralisme politique. Ce décret, publié au Journal Officiel, interdit toute activité, réunion ou expression politique sur l’ensemble du territoire.
Ce durcissement du régime se caractérise par une répression accrue contre les leaders d’opinion, dont la disparition forcée de M. El Bachir Thiam (membre du parti YELEMA) et de celle de M. Alassane Abba (membre du parti CODEM), enlevés en mai 2025 dans un climat tendu.
En parallèle, toute demande de manifestation pacifique venant des acteurs autres que les partisans du pouvoir est refusée et les tentatives sont systématiquement dispersées par les forces de sécurité souvent accompagnées par des interpellations et des arrestations.
Ces événements traduisent un rétrécissement de l’espace civique et politique, compromettant les droits fondamentaux à la liberté d’association, d’expression et de réunion. Cette situation constitue un signal d’alerte critique pour les mécanismes de prévention des crises, avec un risque élevé de dérives autoritaires, de frustration sociale et de violences liées à l’exclusion politique.

"Prime Minister and Political Party Undermine Law Association’s Role in Civic Discourse","Event Summary
On 7 July 2025, Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar publicly criticised the Law Association of Trinidad and Tobago (LATT) at a political rally, accusing it of hypocrisy for defending Independent Senators in a recent constitutional debate. On the same day, the United National Congress (UNC) issued a statement via its Public Relations Officer, Dr. Kirk Meighoo, further attacking LATT’s position. The statement questioned the Association’s legitimacy, accused it of misrepresenting the Constitution, and labelled its response to political criticism as “anti-democratic.” These public remarks follow the Law Association’s 6 July press release, which expressed “deep concern” over escalating attacks on the independence and integrity of non-partisan Senators. The Law Association is a central civil society body in Trinidad and Tobago and often speaks on matters of governance, justice, and human rights.
The incident marks a sharp escalation in executive hostility toward a key civil society institution and sets a precedent for how civil society institutions may be treated when they voice dissent. As a consequence, the incident may embolden further political attacks on oversight bodies and discourage civic actors from speaking out. The exchange thus highlights a deterioration in civic discourse and a pattern of delegitimising independent actors who challenge or scrutinise government conduct. This undermines both state–civil society dialogue and public trust.”

"Blocage des plateformes de mobilisation numérique Change.org et Avaaz.org en Algérie","Event Summary
A field survey carried out by the Confédération syndicale des forces productives (COSYFOP ) has revealed a total and systematic blocking of the online petition platforms Change.org and Avaaz.org throughout Algeria. More than 200 trade union members in various provinces have tried to access these sites via all available Internet service providers, without success. This blocking prevents citizens and organisations from launching or supporting online campaigns, severely limiting freedom of expression and the tools for peaceful mobilisation.
This action is a direct attack on fundamental digital rights, particularly in a context where trade union repression, arbitrary trials and the banning of peaceful demonstrations are already commonplace. Obstructing access to these platforms deprives Algerian civil society of a crucial space to make its voice heard both nationally and internationally. COSYFOP, which tried to launch a campaign on behalf of an arrested trade unionist, denounces this blockage as a form of political censorship.

"Suspension arbitraire de syndicalistes du CNAPEST à Oran et répression de l’activité syndicale indépendante dans le secteur de l’éducation.","Event Summary
On 24 July 2025, the Oran wilaya trade union council of the CNAPEST (Conseil National Autonome du Personnel Enseignant du Secondaire et Technique) denounced the arbitrary precautionary suspension of several trade unionists, including their wilaya coordinator, Mr A. Rahmane Fitas. These measures were taken following the participation of those concerned in peaceful protests organised as part of a national intersyndicale. These actions were aimed at challenging the serious imbalances contained in the new teachers&#8217; statute, which the Ministry of Education has finally recognised and which is currently being revised. Despite this progress, the activists are being unjustly punished, which constitutes a direct attack on trade union rights and freedom of expression. The CNAPEST is calling for the immediate lifting of the sanctions and for investigations into the administrative practices and corruption denounced in the Oran education department.

"Elimination of registry of community kitchens signals reduced state openness to civil society participation on social policies","Event Summary
The Ministry of Human Capital eliminated the National Registry of Community Kitchens and Picnic Areas (RENACOM) through Resolution 393/2025, published on July 22 in the Official Gazette. This registry, created in 2020, made it possible to accredit, geographically locate and channel food assistance to more than 40,000 community spaces. The Government argues that there were flaws in the database and proposes to replace it with face-to-face and technological surveys. Since December 2023, the government of Javier Milei has implemented a series of cuts in social policies under the Ministry of Human Capital. The elimination of RENACOM is part of a process that began months ago, when in February 2024 the sending of food and cash transfers to community kitchens was interrupted. In May, audits by the Ministry claimed that more than half of the 2600 canteens surveyed did not exist, even though those listed were open and operational. This official narrative seeks to justify a profound restructuring that, in fact, implies an invisibilization of solidarity networks that are fundamental to food security.
The elimination of RENACOM eliminates a public source of data for CSOs that work with vulnerable communities, restricting access to information to design intervention strategies, influence public policies, and monitor the right to food. In addition, by reducing the documentary support of the organizations, their financial sustainability is complicated, since many required registration as proof to obtain donations or sign agreements.

"Hong Kong's League of Social Democrats disbands after 19 years under political pressure days before NSL anniversary","Event Summary
On June 29, 2025, the League of Social Democrats (LSD), Hong Kong&#8217;s last active pro-democracy political party, announced its dissolution after 19 years of operation. The decision came just days before the fifth anniversary of Beijing&#8217;s imposition of the National Security Law on July 1, 2020. Party chairperson Chan Po-ying cited &#8220;immense political pressure&#8221; and described the decision as having &#8220;no other choice&#8221; in the face of &#8220;the omnipresence of red lines and the draconian suppression of dissent.&#8221; The LSD had been the only remaining party conducting street booth activities and small pro-democracy protests despite increasing legal risks. Chan Po-ying refused to elaborate on the specific pressures the party had faced. The dissolution follows the earlier closure of other major pro-democracy parties including the Democratic Party (which began dissolution in February 2025) and the Civic Party (disbanded in 2023). The LSD&#8217;s key members, including Leung Kwok-hung and Jimmy Sham, had been imprisoned under national security charges, with Leung serving a six-year sentence and Sham recently released.

"Hong Kong environmental NGO accused of ""soft resistance"" by Beijing-backed media","Event Summary
In July 2025, Beijing-backed newspaper Wen Wei Po accused Hong Kong environmental think tank Liber Research Community of &#8220;soft resistance&#8221; through its ecotourism policy research, marking a significant escalation in the targeting of civil society organizations under the vaguely defined concept. The newspaper ran a full-page report claiming Liber used &#8220;pseudo-science&#8221; to challenge national security, specifically criticizing the NGO&#8217;s research questioning government ecotourism initiatives and their potential environmental impacts. Greenpeace Hong Kong was also named for co-hosting a seminar with Liber after a local university cancelled their venue booking. Liber researcher Brian Wong defended the organization&#8217;s work as &#8220;solid, with methodologies, data, and case studies&#8221; conducted &#8220;for the benefit of Hong Kong&#8217;s people and environment.&#8221; The accusation demonstrates how the term &#8220;soft resistance,&#8221; first introduced by Beijing officials in 2021 without clear definition, is being weaponized against legitimate policy research and environmental advocacy. Justice Minister Paul Lam recently acknowledged that &#8220;soft resistance&#8221; is a political rather than legal term, but officials continue using it to target activities deemed threatening to national security, including academic research, cultural expression, and policy advocacy.

"Hong Kong proposes tightening prison rules to restrict visits and rights of inmates on national security grounds","Event Summary
On 18 July 2025, the Hong Kong government gazetted sweeping amendments to prison regulations, bringing them into immediate effect. The amendments were first proposed on 3 July 2025, and formally announced on 16 July 2025, with the government confirming their intention to bypass detailed legislative scrutiny through negative vetting procedures. The amendments criminalize resistance to correctional staff with penalties up to six months imprisonment and grant arrest powers to prison officers. The government cited cases where visiting mechanisms were allegedly abused by people using &#8220;humanitarian relief&#8221; as pretext to influence inmates with &#8220;soft tactics&#8221; to incite resistance. The new rules significantly curtail inmates’ rights and visiting arrangements under national security grounds, including the ability to deny access to lawyers, doctors, and religious leaders.
These measures are widely understood to target protestors, pro-democracy activists, and human rights defenders in detention, posing a serious threat to civil society actors engaged in humanitarian relief, legal aid, and advocacy.

"Dhahar armed clashes: A growing risk to civic space","Event Summary
On 15 July 2025, an armed confrontation erupted in Dhahar District between armed forces and community groups previously engaged in dialogue over regional administrative arrangements. The conflict led to the displacement of at least 833 households, approximately 5,000 individuals who have sought refuge in nearby rural villages. The escalation triggered multiple protection risks such as forced displacement and the threat of forced recruitment. It serves as an early warning indicator of how fragile administrative settings can quickly descend into violence, with long-term consequences for CSO presence, effectiveness, and public engagement in the region. The situation calls for immediate attention to ensure protection of affected populations and support to restore safe, inclusive civic space.
As of the latest information, no specific individual affiliated with a CSO has been reported killed, injured, or detained in this incident. However, the overall insecurity and large-scale displacement are likely to disrupt CSO activities in the region. These disruptions threaten the enabling environment for civil society, particularly in terms of access, community engagement, and the continuity of support to vulnerable populations.

"Defunding of the Argentine scientific system impacts CSO’s access to information","Event Summary
The Commission on Science, Technology and Innovation of the Chamber of Deputies  warned on 18 July 2025  about &#8220;the impact of the decrees that modify the structure and operation of key organizations such as the R+D+i Agency, INTI and INTA, as well as the crisis caused by the defunding and attack on science by the Government.&#8221; Since December 2023, the Argentine government has implemented a series of adjustment measures that seriously affect the national scientific and technological system. These policies include the paralysis of admission to scientific careers, mass layoffs, the virtual elimination of the Ministry of Science and Technology, and a drastic cut in the budgets allocated to research. The situation has been  denounced  by multiple academic, scientific and social sectors, including through a  joint statement of the Academic Committees of the Research Institutes of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires .
For CSOs, this situation is particularly serious because it reduces their reliable sources of information and weakens their links with interdisciplinary research teams that have historically accompanied processes of systematization, evaluation and advocacy. This limits the possibility of generating accurate diagnoses of rights violations, as well as the development of evidence-based public policy proposals. The reduction in funding thus not only compromises the future of scientific knowledge in general, but also particularly affects the production of knowledge linked to the social sciences, which are fundamental for civil society organizations. The loss of this investigative capacity limits the possibility of having an informed impact on reality and means that CSOs face greater difficulties in justifying their actions to donors or the State, as they do not have locally produced evidence. The disconnect between CSOs and the scientific system also weakens democratic culture, as access to plural, validated and situated information is hindered.

"Deportation of Afghan Citizens from Tajikistan","Event Summary
On 19 July 2025, Tajikistan officially confirmed the deportation of Afghan citizens citing violations of national laws on the stay of foreign nationals. Officials of the Border Troops of the State Committee for National Security (SCNS) stated that the reasons for the deportations included alleged offences committed by the individuals such as drug trafficking, promotion of extremist ideology, submission of false documents for refugee status, violation of migration rules, holding a third-country citizenship and using Tajikistan as a transit country. 
Afghan refugees and asylum seekers in Tajikistan reported receiving anonymous SMS messages in early July demanding that they leave the country within 15 days or be forcibly deported. These warnings were followed by detentions and deportations, including individuals who were legally residing in Tajikistan with the necessary documentation and refugee registration. Arrests were reported in places like hospitals, educational courses and shopping centers in Vahdat and Rudaki district.
This pattern of forced returns is not limited to Tajikistan, but reflects a broader regional trend among countries hosting Afghan refugees following the Taliban takeover. In the first half of 2025 alone, Iran forcibly deported approximately 1.5 million Afghans, including 410,000 following the end of the Israeli-Iran war in June. During the same period, Pakistan expelled over 300,000 Afghan nationals. These mass deportations have drawn strong criticism from human rights organizations and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, who have called for an immediate cessation of all forced returns, particularly for individuals at risk of persecution, arbitrary detention, or torture upon their return to Afghanistan. Many Afghan refugees in Tajikistan fear for their lives if returned to Afghanistan, as many were former military personnel or officials of the previous Afghan government targeted by the Taliban.

"Overturn of censorship order against journalists highlights vulnerability of freedom of the press","Event Summary
On 2 July 2025, a precautionary measure issued against two journalists to refrain from reporting on the judicial process involving a municipal mayor of a rural town in the east of the country was annulled. The censorship had been ordered days ago, on 26 June 2025, by a judge in the town of Curuguaty, Department of Canindeyú, against two men from the digital press, corresponding to small towns in the region, prohibiting the publication of information on the judicial file opened to a member of the Municipal Council of Yasy Cañy, Department of San Pedro for the alleged crime of cattle rustling.
While the affected media indicated that the judge&#8217;s actions were linked to motives and political relationships, given the absence of arguments in the order ordered, the censorship measure was quickly rejected by the Paraguayan Journalists&#8217; Union (SPP). The union denounced violation of the National Constitution and attack on freedom of expression, presenting claims to the Judiciary to sanction the responsible judge. In the same way, the two journalists achieved a prompt legal defense, observing the violation of fundamental rights and stating that the precautionary measure granted at the request of the mayor was unfounded since the facts disclosed corresponded to official and public documents.
A few days after the censorship measure obtained an immediate response from the affected union and speed in the defense of the pressmen, registering wide dissemination of the fact, with headlines in national media, the same judge who had issued the precautionary measure went on to revoke it. It dismissed the amparo action requested by the municipal mayor, indicating, among other points, that the journalists had acted within the framework of freedom of expression and respected the principle of presumption of innocence. The event illustrates on the one hand the sudden conditions of high vulnerability in which citizens&#8217; rights to receive information and in turn to inform can be placed. It also illustrates the importance of the exercise of defense, particularly necessary in areas relatively distant from large cities.

"Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court rules Emergency Regulations imposed by then Acting President violated fundamental rights","Event Summary
On 23 July 2025, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka delivered a landmark judgment affirming the legal limits of executive authority. In a majority decision delivered by a three-judge bench, the Court held that the Proclamation and emergency regulations promulgated by then-Acting President Ranil Wickremesinghe in July 2022 constituted a violation of fundamental human rights. These regulations, ostensibly enforced to suppress widespread public protests and reassert state control, conferred sweeping powers upon the police and armed forces, including the authority to arrest and detain without warrant, impose curfews, and prohibit public gatherings.
This ruling was in response to multiple fundamental rights petitions filed by civil society actors, including human rights advocates and former human rights commissioners. The petitioners challenged the legality, proportionality, and constitutional validity of the emergency regulations issued during the height of the 2022 mass protest movement, commonly referred to as the “Aragalaya” (The Struggle). The Supreme Court found that the Proclamation issues under Section 2 and emergency regulations promulgated under Section 5 of the Public Security Ordinance lacked both reasonable justification and legal necessity, and amounted to a disproportionate infringement of constitutionally protected freedoms.
The decision opens important opportunities for civil society to push for broader legal and institutional reforms. In particular, it could serve as a catalyst for reviewing and amending the Public Security Ordinance. The ruling also strengthens the case for institutionalising judicial oversight of emergency powers and offers a robust precedent for future strategic litigation to protect civic freedoms. Civil society actors are now well-positioned to engage in advocacy and legal reform that builds on this legal momentum.

"Armed Attack on Kenya Human Rights Commission’s (KHRC) Mother’s Forum ahead of Saba Saba Protests","Event Summary
On 6 July 2025, armed and masked goons stormed and attacked a press briefing by mothers of victims of police brutality at the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) offices in Nairobi, in an alleged effort to deter and prevent the meeting from continuing, under the notion that the meeting was meant to plan for the Saba Saba protests. The press briefing, which had started as a peaceful gathering, took a different turn as CCTV cameras captured the goons flaunting wooden clubs, forcefully and violently accessing the compound after overpowering private guards, demanding that everyone leave the premises while stating there would be no protests on 7 July 2025. The incident was widely reported in the media, including by The Star and Nation, which highlighted the violent nature of the disruption and the clear targeting of civic actors.
This led to journalists, mothers, and human rights activists present scampering for safety, while the goons made away with people’s properties, including electronics—among them laptops, phones, and equipment belonging to journalists. Some of the mothers were left in tears and stranded, having brought their children with them. The victims of the attack reported the incident at the Muthangari Police Station, with the police committing to investigate.
The attack was preceded by the illegal deportation to Uganda of Martin Mavenjina, a Senior Programme and Legal Advisor on Transitional Justice at KHRC, allegedly under unclear circumstances, despite possessing a valid work permit earlier in the day—signifying a broader threat to democracy and collective freedoms.
As a result of the incident, several actors issued public condemnations. On the same day, 6 July 2025, the Police Reforms Working Group, which includes Transparency International Kenya, released a joint press statement, terming the attack a grave assault on Kenya’s constitutional freedoms and democratic principles. The statement demanded an impartial investigation, the prosecution of the perpetrators, and guarantees of safety for all civic actors involved. Different actors condemned the attack and called for the  arrest and persecution of the perpetrators as they were well captured further  terming the attack as a threat and intimidation on human rights activists.
The attacks was preceded by the illegal deportation to Uganda of Martin Mavenjina a Senior Programme and Legal Advisor on Transitional Justice at KHRC allegedly under unclear circumstances even after possessing a valid work permit  earlier in the day  signifying a threat to democracy and collective freedom.
The attack occurred on the eve of Saba Saba, commemorated annually on July 7th which is a significant date in Kenya’s pro-democracy history that marks the struggle for civil liberties, political reform, and social justice. In recent years, Saba Saba has become an important civic moment for citizens, civil society organisations, and human rights defenders to speak out against state excesses, including police brutality, shrinking civic space, and impunity. The 2025 Saba Saba commemoration came in the wake of widespread June protests that followed the killing of Albert Ojwang, a political blogger, which drew national outrage over police violence, arbitrary arrests, and the use of excessive force against peaceful demonstrators. The mothers&#8217; forum held at KHRC was convened to provide a platform for women to mourn victims of police violence raise concerns about state repression, demand accountability and to seek justice for victims of police violence specifically, those murdered, injured or disappeared as a result of recent protests. Its violent interruption, not only breached the right to peaceful assembly guaranteed under the constitution but also demonstrated an increasingly hostile attitude by the state towards public accountability for violence and reform within the police service.
As of 25 July 2025, no arrests have been made and investigations have yet to yield any visible results. The event is seen as part of an ongoing pattern of shrinking civic space in Kenya, particularly the use of intimidation tactics and state inaction in response to threats against civil society and human rights defenders.

"Attempts to restrict the funding sources of civil society organizations","Event Summary
The Knesset&#8217;s Constitution, Law and Justice Committee is advancing a bill that would impose a tax on many Israeli CSOs that receive donations from foreign governmental entities. According to the bill (Proposal No. 5222/2, 2024), currently being prepared for a first reading, any NGO that reports having received such funding (above a threshold yet to be determined) will be required to attach a declaration stating that it will refrain from actions (prohibited to senior civil servants) such as: criticizing the government or its ministries, lobbying the Knesset for the following three years.
This would prohibit most advocacy actions undertaken by CSOs in relation to government and parliament. If an organization refuses to sign the declaration it will be subject to a 23% tax, the same as Israel’s corporate tax rate. If it signs but then violates the commitment it will face a 46% tax in addition to financial penalties and legal measures.
The current bill is an updated version of a previous proposal which sought to impose an 80% tax on certain NGOs receiving support from foreign state entities. The revised version, submitted by Committee Chair MK Simcha Rothman, would affect a far broader group of NGOs than the original draft. Both supporters and opponents believe that if passed, the bill will effectively halt donations from foreign governmental sources making the lowered tax rates irrelevant in practice.
Due to the Knesset’s summer recess and a coalition political crisis, it remains unclear whether the committee will move forward with the bill. However, the committee discussion held on 21 July 2025, demonstrated a clear intent by key coalition members to significantly restrict foreign governmental funding to Israeli CSOs, a position stated explicitly by Finance Minister, MK Bezalel Smotrich.

"Refoulement arbitraire de Nassera Dutour à l’aéroport d’Alger","Event Summary
Le 30 juillet 2025, Nassera Dutour, militante algérienne des droits humains et présidente du CFDA (Collectif des Familles de Disparu·e·s en Algérie) et de la FEMED (Fédération Euro-méditerranéenne Contre les Disparitions Forcées) a été refoulée à son arrivée à l’aéroport Houari Boumediene d’Alger. Sans explication, malgré sa nationalité algérienne, elle a été retenue trois heures puis expulsée vers la France. Ce refoulement constitue une violation de la Constitution algérienne et du droit international. Nassera Dutour, mère d’un disparu, est une figure emblématique de la lutte contre les disparitions forcées en Algérie. Cet événement marque un dangereux précédent et reflète une tentative manifeste de museler la société civile et les défenseur·e·s des droits humains.

"Hong Kong Government issues arrest warrants and bounties for 19 overseas activists linked to shadow legislature in exile","Event Summary
On 25 July 2025, Hong Kong national security police issued arrest warrants for 19 overseas activists accused of subversion under the National Security Law for their involvement in the &#8220;Hong Kong Parliament,&#8221; a shadow legislature formed by pro-democracy activists in exile. The group held unofficial elections in May 2025, attracting 15,702 votes to elect 15 members from 18 candidates, with a virtual swearing-in ceremony on July 14. Four activists &#8211; Elmer Yuen, Victor Ho, Johnny Fok, and Tony Choi &#8211; face HK$1 million bounties for founding the organization, while 15 others have HK$200,000 bounties for participating in the election or being sworn in as members. The activists are based across Taiwan, Thailand, Australia, US, Canada, and UK. Among those wanted are academic Feng Chongyi and businessman Elmer Yuen. Six of the newly wanted individuals were reportedly members of the Taiwan-based Hong Kong Democratic Independence Union. Police accused the group of attempting to &#8220;unlawfully overthrow and undermine the constitutional system&#8221; and warned that providing any assistance to the organization violates the National Security Law. This brings the total number of individuals wanted for alleged national security violations to 34, marking the largest single round of arrest warrants issued under extraterritorial application of Hong Kong&#8217;s security legislation.
This development represents a significant escalation in the transnational repression of civil society and political dissent. The use of extraterritorial legal instruments to target activists abroad undermines international norms, threatens freedom of association, and creates a chilling effect on diaspora communities and global solidarity networks.

"National Human Rights Commission's community engagement provides opportunity for state-civil society responsiveness and validates role of CSOs","Event Summary
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of India organized a two‑day Camp Sitting in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, from 21st to 22nd July, 2025, aimed at addressing pending complaints of alleged human rights violations in the state.
A variety of serious cases were addressed, including attacks on journalists and human rights defenders, crimes against women and children, fatalities due to snakebites amid medical neglect, flooding affecting families in coastal districts, allegations of witchcraft‑related violations, and trafficking of young girls during the COVID‑19 period. State authorities and complainants were requested to be present to enable on‑the‑spot resolution and deliberation.
After the hearings, the Commission met with the Chief Secretary, Director General of the Police, and other senior state officials to discuss strategies for protecting and promoting human rights. On 22 July, NHRC representatives engaged with civil society organisations, NGOs and human rights defenders, followed by a media briefing on the outcomes of the sitting.
This initiative aimed not only at expediting the hearing of pending human rights cases but also at reinforcing the role of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and human rights defenders in the broader ecosystem of rights protection. Odisha, with its diverse socio-economic challenges—including vulnerable tribal populations, instances of gender-based violence, trafficking, displacement, and climate-related risks—requires a robust civil society to advocate for justice and equity. Recognizing this, the NHRC’s Camp Sitting included structured engagement with CSOs to understand field realities, challenges faced in advocacy, and policy gaps. The Commission emphasized the importance of creating an enabling environment for CSOs by promoting transparency, access to justice, and responsive governance.
The event also served as a platform for CSOs to raise concerns related to legal barriers, administrative restrictions, and safety risks faced by human rights defenders. Through interaction with senior government officials, the NHRC sought to foster collaborative approaches that respect the independence of civil society while ensuring accountability. This outreach marks a progressive step toward strengthening civic space in India. Through this practice, the NHRC reinforced state accountability and institutional responsiveness. The event also validated the role of CSOs by including them in structured dialogues and consultations, thus enhancing their legitimacy in policy advocacy and community engagement.

"Deterioration of Press Freedom in Peru Amid Recent Acts of Intimidation Against Journalists","Event Summary
In recent weeks, several incidents in Peru have raised serious concerns about press freedom and the safety of journalists. On 8 July 2025, Gudelia Gálvez Tafur, director of the news portal Huaraznoticias.com, reported receiving death threats via WhatsApp after covering alleged irregularities in public works. When she went to the DEPINCRI police station in Huaraz to file a complaint, officers reportedly refused to register it, claiming that no crime had yet been committed. The National Association of Journalists of Peru (ANP) criticized the police response, and the International Federation of Journalists expressed its support for the journalist.
In another case, Juan José Santibáñez, former Minister of the Interior and current official at the Presidential Office, filed a complaint for alleged surveillance (reglaje) against journalists Mónica Delta, Juan Subauste, Carlos Hidalgo, and Jorge Ramírez, as well as the television network Latina TV. The complaint followed a news report documenting the official’s meetings in public spaces. The National Association of Journalists of Peru (ANP) called on the Public Prosecutor’s Office to dismiss the complaint due to a lack of legal basis, warning that it could be seen as an attempt to intimidate the press. The ANP also emphasized that this case presents an opportunity to strengthen the protection of freedom of expression.
On 18 July 2025, the Municipality of Lima issued a public statement accusing the newspaper La República of sabotage against the metropolitan train system, following the publication of an investigative report that exposed the age and poor condition of the railcars and locomotives purchased by the city. Grecia Infante, the journalist who authored the report, received death threats, experienced hacking attempts on her social media accounts, and faced pressure on her family to stop her coverage. The Press and Society Institute (IPYS) reported that supporters of Mayor Rafael López Aliaga went to the newspaper’s headquarters to shout insults and deface the building with graffiti.

"Increasing negative discourse on CSOs by senior Namibian officials","Event Summary
Recent statements by senior Namibian leaders signal a deteriorating enabling environment for civil society organisations (CSOs).
On 27 July 2025, President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, speaking in her capacity as leader of the Swapo Party at the Liberation Movements Summit in Johannesburg, issued a strong criticism of foreign-funded civil society organisations. Addressing representatives from former liberation movements across southern Africa, she linked CSOs and opposition parties to foreign efforts aimed at regime change, grouping them with economic warfare tactics such as sanctions and tariffs. This marks her first overtly hostile statement toward civil society since assuming office on 21 March 2025. The timing and tone of her remarks stand in stark contrast to earlier official positions. Just nine days prior, on 18 July, the President launched Namibia’s Sixth National Development Plan (NDP6), which described civil society as a “key driver of national progress” and called for structured engagement. Her previous public references to CSOs have been diplomatically neutral, suggesting partnership rather than confrontation. The abrupt shift in rhetoric—particularly on an international stage—raises concerns about a hardening stance toward civil society.
On 28 July 2025, at the 15th Summit of Women Speakers of Parliament in Geneva, National Assembly Speaker Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila criticised direct donor funding to CSOs, arguing that such organisations lack democratic legitimacy and may not represent broader societal interests.
These remarks, delivered on prominent international platforms, reflect a growing narrative that delegitimises civil society and questions its role in governance and development. The framing of CSOs as undemocratic or externally manipulated introduces reputational risks and may undermine public trust. It also signals potential policy shifts that could restrict funding channels, impose regulatory constraints, or limit civic engagement.
The cumulative effect of these statements suggests a narrowing of civic space, with implications for advocacy, service delivery, and democratic accountability. International donors and local actors should monitor developments closely, engage in dialogue with government counterparts, and assess risk exposure for CSOs operating in Namibia. Strategic responses may be needed to safeguard civil society’s role and ensure continued support for inclusive governance.

"Threats against France 24 journalist","Event Summary
Since early July 2025, Ms. Rosie Pioth, an independent journalist and France 24 correspondent in Brazzaville and Director of Checking Congo has reportedly been the target of persistent threats. This intimidation campaign appears to be directly linked to her investigation into the 1982 bomb attacks in Brazzaville. The investigation, planned for release in a series of instalments, began publication on 17 July 2025.
According to reports, threats have taken several forms: SMS messages ordering her to halt the investigation under threat of death, anonymous phone calls late at night, unknown individuals visiting her neighborhood to gather information about her residence, and even surveillance.
As a result, the journalist has been forced to flee the country to ensure the safety of herself and her family, thereby halting the continuation of her investigation.
The Journalism and Ethics Congo (JEC) issued a statement condemning the attack and calling for action from Congolese authorities, international community and Congolese journalists.
This case is deeply concerning as it signals a broader climate of fear and repression in which independent journalism is not only discouraged but actively punished &#8211; posing a grave threat to the future of press freedom in the Republic of Congo.

"President Noboa proposes law that would impose new restrictions on civil society organisations","Event Summary
On Tuesday, 29 July 2025, President Daniel Noboa submitted the “Organic Law for the Control of Irregular Capital Flows” to the National Assembly. This bill could require civil society organisations (CSOs) to provide the national government with information about the projects they implement, the funding they receive, and their financial statements. It also introduces grounds for dissolution that could be interpreted ambiguously. If approved, the law could negatively impact Ecuador’s civil society ecosystem, including social organisations, foundations, international donors, private companies, and others.
The proposed legislation opens the door to potential violations of the freedoms of association and expression. It establishes an unfavourable regulatory framework that could limit the ability of CSOs to carry out their work. One of the main concerns is the inclusion of discretionary grounds for dissolution, such as acting “against the fundamental rights of individuals, public order, or national security,” without defining what those terms mean.
Oversight of CSOs would be transferred to the Superintendency of Popular and Solidarity Economy, effectively treating social organisations as economic or commercial entities. The bill mandates that all CSOs implement integrity and transparency systems which, due to their lack of access to technical and financial resources, would disproportionately affect grassroots and community-based organisations.
Several civil society representatives have expressed concern over the proposed law, arguing that it is intended to silence criticism of the presidential administration. They note that if the goal is to address the financing of criminal groups, Ecuador already has laws in place to investigate and prosecute such crimes. Activists and environmental organisations have also spoken out against this law.

"Lebanese investigative journalist detained at Beirut airport under allegations of collaboration with Israel","Event Summary
On 20 July 2025, Lebanese investigative journalist Hajar Knio was detained by General Security officers for hours at Beirut’s Rafic Hariri International Airport under an order from military court government commissioner. The detention was based on allegations of collaboration with Israel, and she was later released but instructed to report for further questioning at the General Security Investigation Branch at the National Museum. Her electronic devices remained seized. Knio denied any contact with Israeli entities, explaining that her reporting references publicly available sources rather than direct communication. She suggested that the detention stems from her investigative reporting on drug‑trafficking networks and her criticism of Hezbollah.
Civil society groups such as Journalists for Freedom condemned the detention, calling it a retaliatory attempt to intimidate dissenting voices and attack journalists. The case shows a deteriorating situation of press freedom, where the space for independent investigative reporting is steadily shrinking.

"Dismissal of the Attorney General","Event Summary
A wide range of civil society organizations in Israel and many leading figures from the business sector have spoken out against the Israeli government&#8217;s unanimous decision to dismiss the Attorney General from office on 4 August 2025. This decision marks a further escalation in the ongoing confrontation between the government and its opponents regarding the nature of governance and the political regime in Israel. The dismissal comes in the wake of the AG’s consistent legal and professional opposition to many government actions, including moves that might reduce the scope of action for CSOs, based on concerns that they threaten the democratic character of the Israeli regime.
Her dismissal was approved through a procedure whose legality is in question and will be reviewed by the Supreme Court. The government ignored its own long-standing procedure regulating such dismissals which requires consultation with a special selection committee that had previously reviewed and approved the Attorney General’s candidacy. This procedure exists to ensure the independence of the Attorney General.
The committee, chaired by retired Supreme Court President Asher Grunis, was not convened due to the Justice Minister’s difficulty in assembling a majority within the committee in support of the dismissal. To bypass this obstacle, the government appointed a new special ministerial committee. The committee summoned the Attorney General for two hearings (on June 14 and 17, 2025), which she refused to attend, arguing that the procedure was unlawful, its outcome predetermined, and that it was merely a façade. The committee subsequently decided to dismiss her.
The ministers justified the dismissal by claiming that the Attorney General was obstructing government actions and policies. According to Justice Minister Yariv Levin, the persistent disagreements have led to paralysis in many areas of government activity.
Most legal experts believe that the Supreme Court will strike down the dismissal due to procedural irregularities. In any case, the decision marks a new high point in the intense legal, political, and public struggle that has been unfolding in Israel for the past two and a half years.
Following the decision, civil society organizations filed petitions with the Supreme Court to halt the move, and a wide range of protest events are being planned.

"The Inter-American Court of Human Rights issues a ruling on legal representation, and the Amazonas Court excludes lawyers for defendants in the Baguazo case.","Event Summary
The Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) issued two resolutions requesting the Peruvian State to ensure that victims of human rights violations can continue to be represented by the organizations that have supported them, without incurring consequences under Law No. 32301 on the Peruvian Agency for International Cooperation. The law penalises the &#8220;improper use&#8221; of resources and donations intended to “advise, support, or fund” administrative, judicial, or other actions &#8211; whether within Peru or abroad &#8211; against the Peruvian State. According to the Court, this legislation, along with its possible regulations, may constitute an indirect way of limiting the exercise of the right to legal representation. The resolution of July 2, 2025, indicates that the mere possibility of a sanction may violate Article 53 of the Court’s Rules of Procedure and the victims’ right to choose their defense freely. In May 2025, the Court had also expressed concerns as an obstacle to the functioning of human rights defender organisations, and that it would affect freedom of association and expression.
Subsequently, on July 21, a hearing was held before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), attended by civil society organizations and representatives of the State. During the hearing, the State affirmed that there are no restrictions on continuing to represent victims, provided that international cooperation funds, which constitute a primary source of funding for many of these organizations, are not used.
At the national level, impacts linked to this legislation have been recorded. The Superior Court of Justice of Amazonas (Amazonas) dismissed three lawyers representing Indigenous leaders prosecuted in the case known as “Baguazo,” applying the amendment of the Creation of the Peruvian Agency for International Cooperation Law (APCI). The lawyers requested to continue their defense to avoid leaving the defendants without representation, but the court decided to remove them from the proceedings and give the defendants three days to appoint new legal counsel.
The impact of Law No. 32301 on the enabling environment continues to send a chilling effect on civil society in Peru, and further developments need to be monitored.

"Key CSO and Faith Based Organiations (FBO) leaders appointed to Human Rights Commission Board in Zambia","Event Summary
On 28th July 2025, President Hakainde Hichilema announced the appointment of a new board for the Human Rights Commission (HRC) in accordance with Section 7(1) of the Human Rights Commission Act No. 4 of 2024. The new Chairperson is Dr. Pamela Sambo, a distinguished academic and long-standing human rights advocate, with Dr. Felicity Kalunga appointed as Deputy Chairperson. Other commissioners are Bishop Emmanuel Yona Chikoya, Ms. Panic Malawo Chilufya, Ms. Laura Mary Miti, Father Joe Komakoma, and Mr. Fred Wamundila Waluya. The appointments are pending ratification by the National Assembly. Its outcome will depend on how swiftly Parliament acts and how soon the Commission begins to function under the new leadership.
Three of the appointees are prominent civil society leaders: Bishop Chikoya, Ms. Laura Miti, and Father Komakoma. Bishop Chikoya and Ms. Miti are returning commissioners, having served on the previous board, while Father Komakoma is a new addition. Their continued and fresh perspectives are expected to reinforce the Commission’s independence, accountability, and capacity to act as an internal check on government conduct.
With the Access to Information (ATI) framework under the HRC’s jurisdiction, civil society organizations (CSOs) now have a unique opportunity to assess the law’s effectiveness in practice. The new board’s composition, particularly with strong CSO representation, has raised expectations that the Commission will not only safeguard fundamental rights but also actively promote transparency and responsiveness to citizens’ concerns. This development comes amid heightened public demand for transparency, accountability, and citizen participation in governance. Civil society Organisations have consistently called for a strong, independent, and well-resourced HRC.

"Investigations into alleged police abuse during protests","Event Summary



On 29 July 2025, in an interview with Televisora Nacional-Channel 2, the country&#8217;s Attorney General indicated that 64 investigations are underway into alleged police abuse committed by members of the security forces during the protests in Bocas del Toro from April to June 2025. Additionally, complaints of similar incidents have been received in the provinces of Veraguas, Chiriquí, and Darién, bringing the total number of police abuse cases under investigation to 95. The Attorney General&#8217;s Office also reported that the case of a minor who died, possibly due to the excessive use of tear gas, is being investigated. The exhumation of the victim&#8217;s body was announced for August.
These investigations are critical for the enabling environment for civil society, as they address concerns over the use of excessive force by police. Civil society and other actors will be following the process closely, as the handling of these cases will signal the state’s willingness to uphold accountability, protect civic space, and ensure that law enforcement operates within human rights standards. Outcomes from these investigations could set important precedents for how similar incidents are addressed in the future.
The Attorney General also reported on the legal actions arising from the protests in Bocas del Toro. He detailed that 281 people have been prosecuted for crimes of arson, apology for crime and attack against public servants, most of whom face precautionary measures other than preventive detention.

"Asesinato del senador y precandidato presidencial Miguel Uribe Turbay (11 de agosto de 2025)","Event Summary
El lunes 11 de agosto de 2025, falleció el senador Miguel Uribe Turbay. Había recibido un disparo durante un mitin político en Bogotá el 7 de junio, mientras se postulaba para la candidatura presidencial para las elecciones de 2026. La muerte de Uribe Turbay, tras dos meses en cuidados intensivos, ha tenido un profundo impacto en un país que ha revivido episodios oscuros de violencia política en las últimas décadas. Se trata de uno de los actos de violencia electoral más graves de los últimos tiempos: aunque un joven de 15 años fue detenido como autor material y otras seis personas fueron capturadas, aún no se ha identificado al autor intelectual del crimen.
El caso ha tenido un impacto nacional e internacional: miles de personas participaron en protestas y actos de duelo, figuras políticas de todos los sectores expresaron su condena y presión para que se haga justicia, y el Gobierno anunció medidas de seguridad extraordinarias para los precandidatos. Este asesinato se produce apenas nueve meses antes de las elecciones presidenciales de Colombia (previstas para marzo de 2026), lo que aumenta la tensión democrática, la polarización y el temor social. El patrón de asesinatos de líderes sociales se ve reforzado por este asesinato de un líder político que era candidato presidencial. En el último año, aunque no se han producido asesinatos como este, la violencia política se ha manifestado en el asesinato de actores sociales a nivel territorial.
El clima electoral ya estaba marcado por la polarización, y la Misión de Observación Electoral había informado de incidentes violentos contra actores políticos, especialmente a nivel local. Este impacto podría afectar significativamente a las elecciones de 2026. Este suceso erosiona la credibilidad del sistema democrático, crea un clima de miedo en los espacios de participación política y refuerza la vulnerabilidad de los contendientes electorales. Podría ser un acontecimiento que desaliente la participación política.
&#8212;-
On Monday, 11 August 2025, Senator Miguel Uribe Turbay passed away. He had been shot during a political rally in Bogotá on 7 June while running for the presidential candidacy for the 2026 elections. Uribe Turbay&#8217;s death, which came after two months in intensive care, has had a profound impact on a country that has relived dark episodes of political violence in recent decades. This is one of the most serious acts of electoral violence in recent times: although a 15-year-old boy was arrested as the perpetrator and six other people were captured, the mastermind behind the crime has not yet been identified.
The case has had a national and international impact: thousands of people participated in protests and acts of mourning, political figures from all sectors expressed their condemnation and pressure for justice, and the government announced extraordinary security measures for the pre-candidates. This murder comes just nine months before Colombia&#8217;s presidential elections (scheduled for March 2026), heightening democratic tension, polarisation and social fear. The pattern of assassinations of social leaders is reinforced by this murder of a political leader who was a presidential candidate. In the last year, although there have been no murders like this one, political violence has manifested itself in the assassination of social actors at the territorial level.
The electoral climate was already marked by polarisation, and the Electoral Observation Mission had been reporting violent incidents against political actors, especially at the local level. This impact could significantly affect the 2026 elections. This event erodes the credibility of the democratic system, creates a climate of fear in spaces for political participation, and reinforces the vulnerability of electoral contenders. It could be an event that discourages political participation.

"Tanzanian Police Directed to Strengthen Online Surveillance During Election Period","Event Summary
The Minister for Home Affairs, Innocent Bashungwa, has instructed the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Camillus Wambura, and the entire Police Force to strengthen &#8220;online patrols&#8221; in the same way street patrols are conducted, in order to curb financial crimes and deter individuals who use online platforms to disrupt public peace. Speaking on 6 August 2025, during the inauguration of the Daraja B Police Station, Bashungwa said: &#8220;I encourage you to remain vigilant and show no leniency toward anyone who might be used by those with ill intentions against our country, especially during this election period to disrupt our national peace.&#8221;
The concept of “online patrols” refers to proactive digital monitoring by law enforcement to detect and address cybercrimes, including financial fraud, scams, and content perceived as threatening public order. Similar measures have been taken in the past, especially during politically sensitive periods, but they have also drawn criticism from human rights groups and civil society organizations, who warn such actions could be used to justify excessive surveillance, censorship, or the suppression of legitimate dissent. Increased monitoring risks curtailing free speech online, especially political dissent, activism, or criticism of government policies. This may create a chilling effect where citizens hesitate to share views or engage in open debate

"Arrest of journalists Following Reporting on Child GBV Case in Adado, Somalia","Event Summary
In early August 2025, two Somali journalists were arbitrarily arrested in Adado, Galmudug State, following their coverage of a serious child protection case involving the alleged rape and killing of an eight-year-old girl.
The two journalists, who had published details of the case based on official sources, were detained by local police shortly after the story gained public attention. Their arrest appears to have been prompted by pressure from a local government official seeking to suppress coverage of the incident. On the same day, a woman claiming to be the victim’s mother released a contradictory video statement, which was later discredited when she and other suspects were taken into police custody.
Although this is the first documented case linked directly to reporting on a child protection and GBV incident in Adado, this incident reflects growing concerns about media suppression, lack of accountability in child protection cases, and the misuse of authority to obstruct justice. It underscores the urgent need for transparent investigations and stronger safeguards for journalists reporting on issues of public interest, particularly cases involving gender-based violence and vulnerable populations.

"Women rights NGO wins lawsuit against fatwa limiting its freedom to act and speak","Event Summary
SIS Forum (Malaysia) (previously known as Sisters in Islam) is a civil society organisation that advocates for the rights of Muslim women. In 2014, a fatwa issued by the Selangor State Fatwa Committee declared that any individual, organisation, or institution holding “liberalism and religious pluralism” beliefs—specifically naming SIS Forum (Malaysia)—was “deviant” from Islamic teachings. It called for the banning and seizure of related publications and instructed the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) to block websites containing such content. SIS was neither informed nor consulted prior to the fatwa’s issuance.
SIS filed for judicial review and leave was granted in December 2014. The case saw conflicting decisions over the years, but on 19 June 2025, the Federal Court ruled by a 3–1 majority that the fatwa did not apply to SIS Forum (Malaysia), as it is a company and not a natural person capable of professing Islam. The Court also struck down the fatwa’s directives involving the MCMC for exceeding state jurisdiction. The bench made no findings on the substance of the fatwa, noting this was within Selangor Islamic Religious Council’s domain. The SIS ruling mirrors recent constitutional rulings that reassert federal supremacy over religious overreach.
In response to the ruling, Sultan Shaarafuddin urged the organisation to cease using “Sisters in Islam” in any form of publication across all platforms associated with the organisation. He justified the call as necessary to prevent “arbitrary use” of the word “Islam” for the organisation’s benefit and interests, whilst citing potential public confusion.
On 31 July 2025, Sisters in Islam, announced that it would drop the word “Islam” from its public-facing name in response to this “advice” and stated that it would henceforth sign off as “SIS Forum (Malaysia)”. Despite the change in name, SIS Forum (Malaysia) reaffirmed its commitment to advocating for Muslim women’s rights in Malaysia.

"Suppression of Civil Society Protest on Internet Price Increase, Somaliland","Event Summary
On 7 August 2025, the telecommunications companies Sometel and Telsom in Somaliland significantly increased internet prices, causing widespread concern among the public. This has sparked significant public concern, especially among civil society organizations (CSOs), youth groups, legal professionals, and journalists who rely heavily on digital connectivity for their work and activism. In response, various civil society actors including youth groups, lawyers, and journalists, planned to hold a peaceful protest to voice their opposition to the price rise and its impact on accessibility and communication.
However, the Somaliland police denied permission for the protest and subsequently prevented the demonstration from taking place. This action directly restricts the civil society’s fundamental rights to freedom of assembly and expression, which are essential components of an enabling environment for civil society organizations (CSOs).
The police’s refusal to allow the peaceful protest not only undermines the ability of CSOs to organize and advocate for community interests but also creates a negative effect that may discourage future civic engagement and activism. The event highlights ongoing challenges faced by civil society in Somaliland regarding their operational space and raises concerns about respect for democratic freedoms.

"New bill regulating protest on public roads","Event Summary
On 21 July 2025, members of Congress backed by Cambio Radical filed a new statutory bill that recognises the constitutional right to protest but proposes strict regulations for demonstrations on public roads that affect the mobility, health, work or safety of third parties. This development follows the shelving of the Statutory Bill 166 of 2024 by Congress in May 2025. This was an initiative developed in dialogue with social organisations, the Ministry of the Interior and the OHCHR. The bill sought to regulate, guarantee, and protect the right to peaceful social protest, complying with national and international standards and strengthening the legal framework for safe public demonstrations. This new bill comes at a time when Colombia is undergoing a period of mobilisation and debate on social justice, and could redefine the practice of the right to protest in the country.
The shelving of the bill that sought to protect the right to protest exacerbates the vulnerability of this right, at a time when the country is experiencing social tensions and requires flexibility in citizen participation. The new bill promoted by Cambio Radical, although it seeks to balance rights, could restrict the capacity to protest if clear safeguards are not guaranteed. It rejects the dialogue that had been built with civil society actors and the United Nations, while having a risk of restricting effective protest in practice, placing bureaucratic barriers, justifying intervention and possibly criminalising demonstrations in strategic public spaces. Its focus represents a regulatory shift that could place additional barriers to peaceful protest.

"Consulta ciudadana para la creación de la Comisión Intersectorial de implementación del Acuerdo de Escazú","Event Summary
On 2 August 2025, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development opened a 15-day public consultation (until 15 August) to gather comments and proposals on the draft decree that will create the Intersectoral Commission for the implementation of the Escazú Regional Agreement in Colombia. Once established, this commission will have as its main functions to coordinate, formulate and monitor the &#8220;Roadmap for the Implementation of the Escazú Agreement,&#8221; as well as to design mechanisms for monitoring, evaluation, reporting and improvement in environmental matters. The Escazú Agreement, ratified by Colombia through Law 2273 of 2022 and declared enforceable by the Constitutional Court in September 2024, seeks to guarantee access to information, public participation and justice in environmental matters, and to protect those who defend the environment and the territory. The consultation is presented as a key step towards incorporating a human rights, gender, ethnic, territorial and generational perspective and institutionally legitimising the design of implementation.
The consultation is taking place within the context of growing demands for the participatory and legitimate institutionalisation of international instruments for environmental democracy. Colombia has made legal progress with the ratification and implementation of the Escazú Agreement, but now needs to translate this progress into effective action. The draft decree seeks to consolidate an intersectoral mechanism with a differential approach, but its coordination with existing entities still needs to be clearly defined. The implementation of the agreement is part of a series of initiatives that, in addition to deepening open government in Colombia, can contribute to the protection of environmental leaders.

"Society for Protection of the Harbour disbands after 30 years following legislative changes weakening harbour protection laws","Event Summary
On 2 August 2025, the Society for Protection of the Harbour announced its disbandment after 30 years of advocacy, citing legislative amendments that weakened legal protections for Victoria Harbour. The organization ceased operations following May 2025 changes to the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance that relaxed rules on harbour reclamation. Founder Winston Chu, an 85-year-old lawyer, stated the group was &#8220;no longer able to effectively protect the harbour by law&#8221; as legal protections had been repealed, including requirements for &#8220;overriding public need&#8221; before reclamation projects could proceed. The amendments allow the government to replace courts in determining &#8220;public need&#8221; for reclamation projects and permit small-scale reclamation projects up to 0.8 hectares without judicial oversight. The society had made over 20 submissions opposing the changes, with only half receiving government replies that failed to address core concerns about the government becoming &#8220;judge of its own cause.&#8221; The group also resigned from the government-appointed Harbourfront Commission. Vice-chairman Hardy Lok said unanimous decision was made as the organization could no longer fulfil its mission under the new legal framework. Winston Chu specifically denied connections to Development Secretary Bernadette Linn&#8217;s &#8220;soft resistance&#8221; warnings, stating the decision was made over a year ago and expressing hope that government would exercise control &#8220;in a wise and fair manner.&#8221;
This event is part of an established pattern of civil society organizations dissolving or reducing operations due to legislative and regulatory changes that eliminate their ability to fulfil their missions effectively. The disbandment follows the broader trend of civil society groups facing systematic constraints through legal and administrative changes rather than direct suppression.

"Peruvian environmental defender murdered in the Amazon in a suspected targeted attack","Event Summary
Hipólito Quispe Huamán, an environmental defender from the Tambopata National Reserve, was murdered on 26 July 2025.  He was a founding member of the Nueva Esperanza Farmers Association of Santa Rosa and participated in the Tambopata National Reserve Management Committee. Through this role, he contributed to forest conservation efforts and collaborated with others to combat illegal mining and safeguard the reserve’s buffer zone. Authorities took more than 12 hours to recover his body, prompting public criticism of both the government and the Intersectoral Mechanism for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders.
On 31 July 2025, the Management Committee released a statement urging the government to provide immediate protection and resources for Quispe Huamán’s family. The National Coordinator for Human Rights (CNDDHH) condemned the killing and called on the Peruvian state to take urgent and effective action to protect the lives and work of human rights defenders. The Management Committee also expressed concern over the State’s failure to implement the protection mechanism in a timely and adequate manner. The Ombudsman’s Office also issued a statement, condemning the murder and urging the Public Prosecutor’s Office to advance the investigation swiftly, activate all relevant protocols, identify those responsible, and offer support to the victim’s family through the Victim and Witness Assistance Unit. The case has been taken up by the Supraprovincial Prosecutor’s Office Specialized in Human Rights and Interculturality, as it is being investigated as a possible homicide related to Quispe Huamán’s environmental advocacy.
This incident highlights the level of violence in areas most affected by illegal mining and other environmental crimes in Peru. Defenders who speak out against illegal mining, logging, and drug trafficking—especially Indigenous leaders and community organizers—face intimidation, criminalization, and targeted killings. A report by ProPurús and ORAU, using Ministry of Justice data, documented that more than 650 defenders and their families faced risk situations between 2019 and 2024, with over half of the cases concentrated in Amazonian departments like Loreto, Ucayali, San Martín, Amazonas, and Madre de Dios.

"Activist Amir Hariri Acquitted Following Landmark Federal Court Ruling Striking Down Section 9(5) of the Peaceful Assembly Act","Event Summary
On 8 August 2025, former Muda secretary-general and current Mandiri executive director Amir Hariri Abd Hadi was acquitted of a charge under Section 9(5) of the Peaceful Assembly Act 2012 (PAA) for allegedly failing to notify authorities before organising the “#ManaKapalLCS” rally on 14 August 2022. Magistrate Farah Nabihah Muhamad Dan granted the acquittal after the prosecution confirmed it had no intention to re-charge Amir. The court also ordered the return of his bail in full.
Amir had been charged on 26 August 2022, a week after the rally outside Sogo shopping complex in Kuala Lumpur, which called for government accountability in the littoral combat ship (LCS) procurement scandal. He pleaded not guilty and was released on RM4,000 bail.
The acquittal followed the Federal Court’s July 2025 decision declaring Section 9(5) unconstitutional for criminalising peaceful assembly organisers who fail to give five days’ notice to the police. The Court found the provision inconsistent with the constitutional right to peaceful assembly under Article 10(2)(b) of the Federal Constitution (FC) read together with Article 8(1) of the FC. In striking down Section 9(5) as unconstitutional, the Federal Court found the provision to be disproportionate, discriminatory, and tantamount to a prohibition rather than a restriction. It remitted Amir’s case to the High Court for expeditious disposal in line with its judgment, paving the way for the charge to be dropped.

"Pink Dot HK cancelled after West Kowloon Cultural District Authority denies venue","Event Summary
On August 1, 2025, organizers of Pink Dot HK announced the cancellation of Hong Kong&#8217;s largest annual LGBTQ carnival, originally scheduled for October 12, 2025, after the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority denied venue rental without explanation. The organizing committee had engaged with the authority early in the year to rent Art Park for the 11th edition of the event. However, during planning preparations, they were notified that the venue could not be rented to them with no reason provided. Given the tight timeline and limited suitable outdoor venues, organizers were unable to secure an alternative location on short notice, forcing the difficult decision to cancel. The 2024 Pink Dot celebrated its 10th anniversary at the same venue with over 36 corporate sponsors, the most in the event&#8217;s history, and attracted more than 13,000 visitors in 2023. The cancellation comes amid narrowing space for LGBTQ advocacy in Hong Kong, with the last pride parade held in 2018. When contacted, the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority stated it &#8220;reviews venue hire applications in accordance with established procedures&#8221; but declined to comment on individual cases. Government-funded venues have become increasingly reluctant to host potentially controversial events, reflecting broader pressures on institutions to avoid activities that might be deemed politically sensitive. The lack of explanation from the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority follows patterns seen with other civil society organizations where venue cancellations occur without clear justification.
The cancellation occurs as the government attempts to pass a controversial same-sex partnership bill facing strong opposition in the Legislative Council. Additionally, it has multiple immediate impacts on Hong Kong&#8217;s enabling environment. It eliminates the most visible annual platform for LGBTQ advocacy and community building, reducing opportunities for public education and awareness-raising about LGBTQ issues. The venue denial without explanation creates uncertainty for other civil society organizations about venue accessibility. The timing during legislative debates over same-sex partnership rights reduces momentum for LGBTQ advocacy when community mobilization is most needed. Corporate sponsors and supporters lose opportunities to publicly demonstrate support for diversity and inclusion, potentially affecting business engagement with LGBTQ issues. The cancellation also affects international perceptions of Hong Kong&#8217;s commitment to diversity and inclusion, potentially impacting the city&#8217;s reputation as an international business hub that welcomes diverse communities.

"Unprecedented crackdown against foremost human rights organization signals shrinking civic space","Event Summary
In an unprecedented development, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), the country’s foremost independent rights watchdog has reported a systematic clampdown on its operations by state authorities during the months of June and July 2025. In a public statement issued on 2 July 2025, HRCP described a series of “arbitrary, illegal, and unjustified actions” that have hindered its ability to function freely, marking what it termed the most serious interference in its 38-year history. The Commission highlighted that for the first time, its meetings and public consultations—particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad were forcibly cancelled after hotels, under state pressure, demanded official “No Objection Certificates (NOCs)” to proceed. HRCP clarified that such NOC requirements had never been imposed on their programming before, indicating a shift in bureaucratic tactics to suppress civil society discourse.
The Commission’s operations in Lahore also faced disruption, beginning with the sealing of its office by local authorities in late 2024 on vague municipal grounds. The electricity meter was removed, and a fine of Rs. 3.8 million was levied, while the organization’s bank account was frozen allegedly on the instructions of the State Bank of Pakistan, which later denied such directives in court. These administrative and financial hurdles, HRCP argues, are part of a broader campaign to undermine its institutional autonomy and curtail its role as a vocal advocate for human rights.
Intimidation of individual HRCP members has also intensified. In July 2024, HRCP’s chairperson Asad Iqbal Butt, a 78-year-old veteran human rights defender, was detained from his home and interrogated for several hours by unidentified officials. He was questioned about his support for Baloch activists, and officials reportedly showed him photos of his family participating in advocacy events—an act interpreted as veiled threats. This deeply personal form of pressure has alarmed many in Pakistan’s civil society space, particularly because it was targeted at a senior figure known for decades of peaceful advocacy.
HRCP officials believe the crackdown stems from their continued work on sensitive subjects such as enforced disappearances, the rights of Afghan refugees, and land and resource extraction in Balochistan. These are politically contentious issues in Pakistan, and HRCP remains one of the few organizations willing to openly document and challenge state narratives. The Secretary-General of HRCP, Harris Khalique, noted that although the organization has faced pushback in the past, “it was never like this” suggesting a dangerous escalation in state hostility toward rights-based advocacy.
This crackdown signals not just a targeting of HRCP, but a broader warning to other civil society actors engaging in critical discourse or documenting state violations. By obstructing HRCP’s access to physical venues, financial operations, and digital reach, the state is effectively shrinking civic space under the guise of administrative procedure and national security. This coordinated pressure threatens the very foundations of democratic accountability, especially in a context where freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly are already under strain.

"Murder by Tradition: The Jirga-Ordered Killing of Bano and Ahsan in Balochistan","Event Summary
In mid-July 2025, a deeply disturbing incident from Deghari, a remote district in Balochistan, exposed the continued grip of tribal justice systems and the horrific consequences of honour-based violence in Pakistan. A young couple, Bano Bibi and Ahsan Ullah Samalani, were reportedly murdered on the orders of a local jirga (tribal council) after they married against the wishes of the woman&#8217;s family. The couple had eloped earlier in the year and returned to their village believing tensions had subsided. Instead, they were captured by tribal elders and subjected to a chilling execution. A viral video—which was shared widely across social media platformsshowed the couple being led into the barren desert, ordered to walk seven symbolic steps (a ritualistic marker of guilt), and then shot dead at point-blank range. The footage shocked the nation, fueling public outrage and renewed calls for dismantling jirga systems operating outside the formal legal framework.
According to police reports, the killing was orchestrated by a local tribal leader, Sardar Sherbaz Satakzai, allegedly with the support of the girl&#8217;s own family particularly her mother and brother. The jirga had declared the marriage a breach of tribal honour and issued a verdict for death. The authorities acted swiftly following the uproar, initially arresting 11 suspects, with the number later rising to at least 16, including the tribal elder and close family members. The case was transferred to the Serious Crime Investigation Wing (SCIW) and registered under anti-terrorism and murder charges. In a rare instance of judicial urgency, the Balochistan High Court took suo motu notice, demanding progress reports from the provincial home secretary and police chief, while the Senate of Pakistan unanimously passed a resolution on July 24, 2025, condemning the killings and calling for full accountability and systemic reform.
This incident starkly highlights the ongoing tension between customary tribal practices and Pakistan’s constitutional legal system. Despite the passage of the Anti-Honour Killing Law in 2016, which closed legal loopholes that previously allowed families to “forgive” perpetrators of honour crimes, enforcement remains extremely weak especially in rural areas like Balochistan where jirgas wield parallel authority. Local law enforcement often turns a blind eye or lacks the capacity and political will to confront powerful tribal figures. In 2024 alone, Pakistan reported more than 400 documented cases of honour killings, with likely many more going unreported, and few resulting in meaningful convictions. The case of Bano and Ahsan has become a flashpoint in the ongoing struggle for women’s rights and justice reform in Pakistan. Human rights defenders argue that without dismantling the jirga system, reforming police practices, and expanding victim protection mechanisms, such crimes will continue with impunity masked as tradition.

"Ban on Flying the One Piece Flag: A Threat to Citizens' Expression","Event Summary
Before August 2025, people from various social backgrounds (urban, rural, grassroots, etc.) were widely raising the One Piece flag, which is the flag of the Straw Hat Pirates crew from the anime One Piece. The raising of the flag is done as a form of resistance, protest against perceived injustice, freedom from oppression, and dissatisfaction with the government. Then, at the beginning of August, this movement escalated into an expression and criticism of the government, even spreading widely on social media. Subsequently, through several ministries and local governments, the Indonesian government banned the raising of this flag for various reasons. For example, Budi Gunawan, Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs of Indonesia, stated that this movement was a provocation and could be interpreted as ‘treason.’ In addition, the Minister of Human Rights supported this, saying the ban was in accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and would even seek support from the United Nations.
This ban is another form of silencing citizens’ expression carried out by the Prabowo-Gibran regime. Similar incidents have previously occurred when the People’s Movement under the hashtag #IndonesiaGelap was considered an anarchist movement, pessimistic, influenced by foreign support, eventually leading to a counter-narrative movement called #IndonesiaCerah. In the context of raising a different flag alongside the Red and White flag (Indonesia’s national flag), similar experiences were also felt by the People from Papua when raising the Morning Star flag (Bintang Kejora), as well as the Palestinian flag used in solidarity with the genocide.
In several regions, the prohibition of flying the One Piece flag was even enforced by security forces, with excessive use of force by the military and police as documented by Amnesty International. The government’s actions in response to this are excessive and narrow the civil and political space for citizens to voice or express their concerns, especially relating to public policies. Furthermore, it should be a concern that repetition may lead to the normalization of government actions in the name of nationalism (national security, symbols, state emblems, etc.). Excessive actions must be avoided to reduce legal uncertainty and the arbitrariness of power in using the law.

"Lack of Civil Society Inclusion and Participation in Botswana’s Constitution Review Process","Event Summary
On 4 July 2025, the Government gazetted the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2025, No 14 of 2025 without consulting the public and civil society organisations and without a clear laid out process of how the entire process will be undertaken.
The constitution review process was started in December 2021 and has been repeatedly criticised by civil society organisations for not providing for civic education on the constitution of Botswana to the citizens which would have empowered the Batswana to be able to participate meaningfully and from an informed view point, for  being untransparent, non-participatory and failing to properly articulate the concerns of the people of Botswana. Instead, the proposed constitutional amendments in the then Constitution (Amendment) Bill No.4 of 2024 would result in a regression of the country’s democracy, for example, giving the president powers to appoint ten specially elected members of parliament and appoint the Commissioners of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), which compromises the independence of the legislature and the IEC. Additionally, CSOs were of the view that the Bill failed to adequately protect the promotion of people’s rights from various societal backgrounds, promote equality, national unity, and democracy.
While the current government has announced plans for a people-centred review within six months, early indications of moving ahead without a clear laid out process and participatory framework risk repeating the same exclusionary processes done under the past failed review process. This continuity of approach underscores the ongoing need for vigilance to ensure reforms are transparent, inclusive, and grounded in civic education.
The Bill was gazetted for a 30-day period to allow public responses. During this period, the Botswana Council of Non-Governmental Organisations (BOCONGO) mobilised support to convene a CSO dialogue, including trade unions, to deliberate on the Bill, develop a unified position, and agree on a strategy moving forward. Following the dialogue, a formal CSO response was submitted to the Ministry for State President. Based on the concerns raised, BOCONGO rejected the Constitution Amendment Bill No. 14 of 2025 in its entirety and called for its immediate withdrawal. The position of BOCONGO is that any attempt to amend the Constitution without a clear, participatory framework that is first built on public education undermines the legitimacy of the entire reform process. Furthermore, the statement articulates the need to protect robust socio-economic rights by inserting them into the Constitution and that only a people-led, inclusive, and transparent process can deliver a legitimate and democratic Constitution.
The constitutional reform process, both of the past and the current government, has limited CSOs’ ability to shape constitutional reforms, undermining trust between state and non-state actors and putting core governance principles, transparency, inclusivity, participation, accountability, and democratic legitimacy under strain, thereby weakening the principle of an open and responsive State.
The Bill will next be referred to the House of Chiefs for reading and deliberation, after which it will proceed to Parliament for its third and final reading, deliberations, and voting. This legislative process is still underway, providing a crucial window of opportunity for civil society to continue organising, coordinating, and lobbying against the Bill passing into law. BOCONGO continues to demand the enactment of a Constitutional Review Act to lay out the guiding principles, institutional framework, public participation mechanisms, and procedural steps that will ensure meaningful engagement of all citizens, rural and urban, young and old, women and men, persons with disabilities, and other marginalized groups.
The following demands are put forth:

An explicit acknowledgement that the Constitution belongs to the people, and that the role of MPs and the Executive is to facilitate not dictate the process as is best practice.
The amendment of Sections 87 and 89 of the Constitution of Botswana, and the enactment of legislation (to be called the Botswana Constitution Review Act) to create a people-driven, inclusive constitutional review process.
A complete transparent roadmap to be published. This should indicate some key factors such as extensive public education and consultation process, ensuring that every region and language group in Botswana is engaged meaningfully before any constitutional changes are proposed.
A clear, realistic timeline and clarity on the feasibility of holding two referendums alongside a general election within the next four years as would be the case following the envisioned process by the Government, given the pronouncements of lack of resources. This process cannot be built on vague promises.
Going forward, when proposed amendments to the Constitution are gazetted, that they be gazetted in a Setswana, Kalanga, English, Sekgalagadi and Sesarwa in recognition of our diverse language groups.

"Suspension of trial in emblematic case of violence against journalists further deteriorates freedom of press","Event Summary
On 9 July 2025, the First Sentencing Court of Concepción, in the department of Santa Cruz, began, after more than three years, the trial of the Las Londras case, an emblematic case of violence against six journalists, perpetrated by land grabbers in October 2021 who are accused of the crimes of serious and minor injuries, deprivation of liberty, aggravated robbery, illegal possession or carrying of a weapon of war and attempted homicide and threats.
The second hearing, scheduled for 5 August 2025, was prevented by a conflict of jurisdiction filed by three of the five defendants, who demanded to be tried by the indigenous and original peasant justice system and not by criminal means. The conflict of competence between the indigenous and ordinary jurisdictions must now be resolved by the Plurinational Constitutional Court, a situation that can take months, thereby paralyzing the trial. The only victim who attended this hearing, Percy Suárez, a cameraman for the ATB television network, expressed his indignation at this maneuver, which he described as an &#8220;axe in the back&#8221; for the victims.
The Las Londras case refers to an incident of violence against journalists that occurred on 28 October 2021, when, in addition to Suárez, journalists Silvia Andrea Gómez López and her cameraman Sergio Luis Martínez Galarza of the Unitel Network, Mauricio Egüez Simoné and cameraman Nicolás Alejandro García Iriarte of Red Uno and Jorge Alberto Gutiérrez Ávila of the newspaper El Deber were ambushed and later tortured by an armed group of hooded bullies. The cameraman of the PAT network, Roger Ticona, was able to escape and alert about this fact.
The paralysis of this important trial increases the hostile outlook for the work of journalists and media outlets in Bolivia, which has been aggravated by political polarization ahead of the national elections. Between January and June 2025, the UNITAS Observatory of Rights Defenders recorded 95 violations against press freedom. Of these, 51 (54%) occurred in the context of social conflicts due to national elections and the economic crisis, which have brought with them verbal and physical violence, stigmatization, gender violence, threats and censorship against journalists from national media and international correspondents.
The impact on the enabling environment is severe, as it consolidates a pattern of impunity in crimes against journalists and the media. The paralysis of the trial due to a conflict of jurisdictional competences indefinitely postpones the identification and punishment of those responsible, weakening the credibility of the justice system and citizen confidence in the rule of law. This type of procedural delay directly affects the principle of respect for and protection of fundamental freedoms, since the attack on the six journalists not only violated their right to inform and communicate, but also society&#8217;s right to receive truthful and timely information. Judicial inaction sends a dissuasive message to the press, encouraging self-censorship in the coverage of events involving armed actors or irregular groups. It also erodes state policies and obligations to guarantee justice and protect those who practice journalism, weakening democracy and generating an environment of legal insecurity that encourages the repetition of similar restrictions of the freedom of expression.

"Junta halts NGO/INGO distribution of critical HIV, TB, and malaria medications","Event Summary
On 6 August 2025, Myanmar’s junta-controlled Ministry of Health (MoH) reportedly issued a directive ordering all local and international NGOs/INGOs to immediately halt the distribution of essential medications, including Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) drugs, and malaria treatments. The directive also suspends related programs such as HIV prevention education. Previously, these life-saving treatments were distributed nationwide by NGOs with support from international donors like USAID and the Global Fund. Under the new directive, all supplies must be handed over to the National AIDS Program (NAP) and distributed solely through the MoH. Reports indicates that NGO clinics in major cities—Yangon, Mandalay, Ayeyarwady—have closed, staff have been laid off, and organizations like Marie Stopes International and IOM have forced to surrender their supplies to government.
The directive undermines trust, restricts operational space, and signals increasing authoritarian control over civil society functions. By mandating the immediate cessation of NGO-led distribution of critical medications and redirecting donor-funded supplies exclusively through the Ministry of Health, the government is effectively displacing civil society from essential service delivery roles. This not only undermines the operational space of NGOs/INGOs but also threatens their financial sustainability, as donor funding—previously channeled through these organizations—is now being rerouted to state institutions. The lack of consultation and abrupt enforcement further erodes trust and collaboration between civil society and the state. These developments significantly weaken the enabling environment for civil society, particularly in the health sector, and risk reversing years of progress in public health and rights-based service provision.

"Court of Final Appeal rejects media regulator's final appeal, upholding press freedom victory for satirical RTHK show","Event Summary
On 8 August 2025, Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of Final Appeal rejected the Communications Authority&#8217;s final appeal bid to challenge a lower court ruling that government-funded broadcaster RTHK&#8216;s satirical show &#8220;Headliner&#8221; did not breach broadcasting codes. Three judges dismissed the application on the ground that “it discloses no reasonable grounds for leave to appeal,” exhausting all government attempts to overturn the ruling. The legal battle began in 2020 when the Communications Authority issued warnings against a February 14, 2020 episode that jokingly suggested police had more protective gear than healthcare workers during COVID-19. The RTHK Programme Staff Union and Hong Kong Journalists Association successfully challenged the warnings through judicial review, with courts ruling the satirical program did not violate broadcasting standards. The final victory clarifies important principles for media regulation, establishing that satirical programs have greater freedom for exaggeration while regulators must distinguish between criticism of &#8220;conduct&#8221; versus &#8220;status&#8221; and consider overall program context rather than isolated segments.
The judgment affirms satirical programs&#8217; unique role in artistic expression and social commentary, representing a significant victory for press freedom. However, the damage cannot be undone as RTHK already cancelled &#8220;Headliner&#8221; hours after the original warning in 2020, despite the program team&#8217;s ultimate vindication after five years of legal battle. Whether this ruling leads to lasting improvements in regulatory practices and protections for critical media content is yet to be seen.

"Police Block and Question Protesters at Parliament, Highlighting Growing Threats to Peaceful Assembly in Malaysia","Event Summary
On 14 August 2025, S. Arutchelvan, deputy chairperson of Parti Sosialis Malaysia (PSM), appeared at IPD Dang Wangi police headquarters for questioning under Sections 353 and 427 of the Penal Code, following a police report alleging injury and phone damage during a scuffle outside Parliament on 13 August. The incident occurred during the submission of a draft Workers’ Housing Scheme Bill, where around 500 protesters were blocked by police. The 13 August assembly was organised by the Plantation Community Support Committee, with Arutchelvan serving as adviser. Video footage shows tensions escalating, with protesters shouting and Arutchelvan falling during the confrontation.
Despite prior notification to authorities and legal provisions under the Peaceful Assembly Act, the police framed the protest as provocation. Civil society actors view the investigation and treatment of Arutchelvan as intimidation, called for the police to drop the investigation and raised concerns about shrinking space for peaceful assembly and advocacy. Protesters who were injured during the scuffle outside Parliament have now indicated that they will file their own police reports. The incident reflects a restrictive enabling environment for civil society, where lawful protest is met with criminal investigation, undermining public participation and democratic engagement.
If the investigation into Arutchelvan escalates into a formal charge under Sections 353 and/or 427 of the Penal Code (criminal force against a public servant and mischief causing damage) it would represent a sharp escalation in the criminalisation of peaceful assembly. By treating protest activity as violent criminal conduct, the authorities would undermine the constitutional right to assemble and weaken the fragile space for democratic participation.

"Minister of Home Affairs considers Foreign Contribution Regulation Act Renewal for Rural Development Trust","Event Summary
On 11 August 2025, a delegation of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leaders, led by Union Minister K. Rammohan Naidu, met Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi to seek renewal of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) registration for the Rural Development Trust (RDT). The delegation, including MPs and MLAs, emphasized RDT’s 55-year legacy of non-partisan work in alleviating poverty, providing healthcare, education, and sustainable development in Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. They noted that FCRA restrictions since 2021 have disrupted RDT’s operations, despite a renewal application submitted three months prior. Shah assured a positive consideration, with a decision expected within a week, offering hope for restoring RDT’s ability to receive foreign donations and continue supporting underprivileged communities.
RDT, founded in 1969, has been a key player in rural upliftment, operating hospitals, schools, and development projects in remote areas. Its FCRA registration, crucial for receiving foreign funds, faced disruptions starting in 2021 when renewal was denied, leading to operational challenges like potential hospital closures and reduced services for the underprivileged. In April 2025, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) explicitly refused renewal following audits, citing allegations of FCRA violations, including misuse of funds for purposes outside approved scopes, suspected benami operations, financial irregularities, and potential leakage of sensitive beneficiary data to foreign agencies, such as those in the US. Organizations like the Legal Rights Protection Forum (LRPF) have called for investigations into these claims, framing them as part of broader FCRA scams involving NGOs in Andhra Pradesh. This fits into a national trend where over 20,000 NGOs have faced cancellations or non-renewals since 2020 due to alleged violations like misuse of funds, inactivity, or non-compliance with caps on administrative expenses (now 20%) and mandatory SBI accounts. Denials surged in 2024-2025, with MHA citing reasons such as defunct operations or economic threats, affecting sectors from healthcare to advocacy.
This event positively influences India’s enabling environment for NGOs by signaling regulatory flexibility amid stringent laws. For actors like RDT, this could restore access to foreign funds essential for its mission, preventing disruptions seen since the 2021 denial. The event highlights a pathway for NGOs to navigate the stringent FCRA framework through political advocacy, as seen in the TDP’s intervention for RDT. This could prompt the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to consider more flexible review processes for development-focused NGOs, particularly those with long-standing community impact. Such tweaks would align with the principle of equitable access to resources, ensuring NGOs serving underserved communities aren’t unduly hampered. However, the event could undermine equity if viewed as favoring politically aligned groups, fostering debates on impartial regulation in a landscape where thousands of NGOs have faced cancellations. Overall, while injecting hope for civil society resilience, it underscores the need for uniform FCRA enforcement to maintain trust.

"Concerns over exclusion of civil society from Supreme Court selection process","Event Summary
On 31 July 2025, President José Raúl Mulino indicated that he would not agree with the State Pact for Justice in the process of selecting new Supreme Court justices. Since 2005, the selection process has included the participation of the State Pact for Justice, composed of six state institutions and three civil society organizations: the National Bar Association, the Ecumenical Committee, and the Citizen Alliance for Justice, a civil society organization that brings together some twenty citizen organizations. It is a non-binding vetting process that allows citizens and media to learn about the candidates. The terms of two Supreme Court justices expire in December 2025, and the Cabinet Council is responsible for making the new appointments.
On 7 August the President of the Republic again questioned the State Pact for Justice and its role in examining the candidates that will be appointed as judges.
Civil society actors such as the Citizen Alliance for Justice and other national stakeholders have spoken out against the president&#8217;s statements. Fundación para el Desarrollo de la Libertad Ciudadana (Transparency International Panama) also made a statement, stating that legislative appointment and ratification, without participatory counterweights from citizens and the media, *although legal* does not guarantee judicial independence or public legitimacy.
Ignoring the importance of the State Pact for Justice weakens and restricts the participation of civil society organizations in public affairs.

"Precautionary embargo measures against two environmentalists for reporting on social media","Event Summary
Between 1 and 4 August 2025, precautionary embargo measures were imposed against two environmental activists and content creators in Costa Rica:  Juan Bautista Alfaro  and  Javier Adelfang . The measures were reportedly requested by a company linked to a tourism project in Playa Panamá (Bahía Papagayo), after both activists used social media to raise concerns about environmental damage and questioned the permits granted for the development.
The embargoes included the blocking of bank accounts, withholding of wages, freezing of credit cards, and restrictions on real estate. Experts and environmentalists have  described  these measures as disproportionate and warned they may amount to  Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation  (SLAPPs) as a tactic to silence people who make complaints about environmental or political abuses.
Both cases triggered strong national reactions. Environmental organizations, such as Asociación Ciudadana ACCEDER, GuanaDefensoras, and Antigentrificación CR released a  public letter , signed by 72 organizations and 3,386 individuals including academics and human rights defenders condemning the measures as acts of intimidation. In response, the Frente Amplio Party (Broad Front Party) introduced a  legislative proposal  to limit the use of preventive embargoes in cases involving matters of public interest.
These developments signal a potential setback for civic freedoms in Costa Rica, highlighting how judicial tools can be misused to restrict freedom of expression and discourage public participation

"Hong Kong independent book fair faces ""soft resistance"" accusations while demonstrating civil society resilience","Event Summary
In July 2025, Hong Kong&#8217;s third annual independent book fair &#8220;Reading Everywhere – Hong Kong Independent Book Fair and Bookstore Festival&#8221; was held at Hunter Bookstore, featuring 14 independent publishers who had been excluded from the official Hong Kong Book Fair. The event demonstrated civil society resilience by providing an uncensored platform for local publishing. However, Beijing-backed newspaper Wen Wei Po published a front-page report under the banner &#8220;Cracking down on soft resistance,&#8221; accusing the fair of promoting an &#8220;atmosphere of soft resistance&#8221; by selling books with messages that &#8220;oppose China and disturb Hong Kong.&#8221; The paper specifically targeted books including Jimmy Lai&#8217;s biography, Emily Lau&#8217;s memoir, and works by pro-democracy commentator Johnny Lau. Organizer Leticia Wong rebutted the accusations as false, stating the fair focuses on local publishing without censorship. In response to the newspaper&#8217;s coverage, Hong Kong police indicated they would investigate bookstores selling &#8220;seditious books&#8221; based on evidence and actual circumstances, while the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department emphasized maintaining national security through licensing conditions. The event highlighted the shrinking space for independent publishing, with publishers facing systematic exclusion from official platforms while being monitored and stigmatized for continuing their work through alternative channels.

"Environmental licensing reform weakens participatory governance and rights protections","Event Summary
On 17 July 2025, Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies approved Bill PL 2159/2021, which drastically weakens environmental licensing. The bill allows high-impact activities (e.g., military operations, infrastructure, agriculture) to bypass Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and public consultations if deemed “low risk.” According to Observatório do Clima (OC, 2025), this shifts the legal burden from mandatory licensing for all impactful activities to a fragmented system where only state-listed projects require oversight. The Guardian labeled it a “Devastation Bill”, citing risks of deforestation, land conflicts, and reduced judicial power to halt violations. The bill now awaits presidential sanction, creating urgency for advocacy to demand a veto.
On 8 August 2025, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva sanctioned the bill with partial vetoes, striking 63 provisions including those allowing medium-impact projects to obtain permits via self-declared online forms and those restricting consultations with Indigenous and Quilombola institutions. However, the main structure of the reform remains, preserving accelerated licensing mechanisms that civil society argues could weaken environmental safeguards.
Environmental licensing is not merely a technical procedure, it is a fundamental tool of participatory governance that allows affected communities, civil society, and oversight institutions to engage in decision-making processes that impact collective well-being and ecological integrity. The bill’s immediate effect is the chilling of participatory governance, as the removal of mandatory public consultations signals to Indigenous groups, quilombola communities, and environmental NGOs that their voices will be systematically excluded from decision-making, setting a dangerous precedent for future legislation. For example, Amazonian communities that previously relied on environmental impact assessments (EIAs) to challenge destructive projects now face a legal void.
Civil society organizations remain mobilized to defend participatory safeguards and prevent the rollback of consultations and environmental oversight. Civil society is currently mobilizing to prevent this outcome, making the situation time-sensitive.

"EU Announces Gradual Reduction of Direct Aid to Trinidad and Tobago","Event Summary
On 3 August 2025, the European Union announced that it will gradually phase down its operations and direct development funding in Trinidad and Tobago. According to the EU Delegation, the decision follows a review of engagement strategies in the Caribbean and reflects Trinidad and Tobago’s classification as a ‘high-income country with improved macroeconomic indicators.’ The EU stated that future cooperation will focus on political dialogue and targeted collaboration in areas such as climate change, security, and regional integration, rather than large-scale development aid. The announcement did not outline a detailed transition plan or replacement funding mechanisms. This change will affect the availability of EU-administered resources previously accessible to local institutions and organisations.
The EU’s decision comes against a backdrop of both economic recovery and persistent social challenges in Trinidad and Tobago. While the country’s GDP per capita classifies it as high-income, structural inequalities, rising crime, and gaps in social protection remain pressing concerns. Many civil society organisations rely on international funding due to limited and conditional state subventions, as documented in the Enabling Environment Baseline Snapshot. Evidence from other Caribbean countries shows the risks of donor withdrawal: research on Barbados and Grenada found that reductions in international donor support contributed to financial strain, operational downsizing, and weakened advocacy among civil society organisations. Barbados, like Trinidad and Tobago, is classified as a high-income country, which makes the study especially useful for showing how similar funding challenges could play out in Trinidad and Tobago. In this case, there is no clear transition plan to replace EU funding streams, heightening concerns over the long-term resilience of the CSO sector. Further, the EU’s departure is significant given its role in supporting systemic governance and rights-based initiatives. Without adequate mitigation, this could lead to reduced civic space and weakened advocacy, particularly for marginalised groups.

"Mass Civil Strike in Israel Demands Hostage Release and End to Gaza War","Event Summary
On 17 August 2025, many Israelis participated in a nationwide civil strike and mass protests organized by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum and the October Council. These groups, representing families of hostages and victims of the war, called for the immediate return of 50 hostages held in Gaza since October 7, 2023, and an end to the war.
Demonstrations began early at hundreds of intersections and culminated in a massive rally in Tel Aviv. The initiative gained widespread support from businesses, civic organizations, academic institutions, and local authorities, many of which suspended operations to allow participation.
Civil society actors viewed the strike as a powerful expression of public solidarity and civic mobilization. While not led by traditional civil society organizations, the event reflects a growing public demand for accountability and peace, with polls showing 70–80% support for a negotiated resolution.
The implications for the enabling environment are significant: the strike demonstrates the resilience of civic space and the potential for broad-based mobilization, even amid conflict. However, the state&#8217;s response and long-term impact on civil society engagement remain to be seen.

"Hong Kong's same-sex partnership bill faces legislative hurdle as committee forgoes public hearings","Event Summary
On 11 July 2025, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council advanced the Registration of Same-sex Partnerships Bill, mandated by a 2023 Court of Final Appeal ruling requiring an alternative framework for same-sex couples by October 2025. The bill grants limited rights—such as medical decisions and post-death arrangements—only to couples with overseas-registered unions. Despite 60% public support for same-sex marriage, 39 of 89 lawmakers, mostly from pro-Beijing parties, oppose the bill. The Bills Committee opted against holding public hearings, instead accepting written submissions. Updates on 11 August 2025 indicate that over 10,700 submissions have now been received, reflecting significant public engagement and ongoing consultation.
Civil society groups, including Hong Kong Marriage Equality, Pink Alliance, and Dear Family Hong Kong, criticized the bill’s narrow scope and lack of consultation. They mobilized petitions and submission guides to amplify LGBTQ voices. Activists argue the bill excludes key rights like inheritance and public housing, and imposes economic barriers.
The rushed legislative process and limited engagement space raise concerns about the enabling environment for civil society, particularly LGBTQ advocacy. The absence of public hearings and compressed timeline undermine inclusive policymaking and restrict meaningful participation.

"Transfer of judicial power to the City of Buenos Aires risks further instrumentalization of the courts","Event Summary
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation ratified the jurisprudence that empowers the Superior Court of Justice (TSJ) of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires to review decisions of the ordinary national justice system based in the city. This position, based on the  Levinas case , implies that a local court can act as a &#8220;superior court&#8221; even in federal cases. The measure has provoked a strong rejection from broad sectors of the national judiciary and trade union and social organizations, which considered it unconstitutional and an attack on federalism. The ruling contradicts  Law 24.588  (&#8220;Cafiero Law&#8221;), which protects national competences in Buenos Aires City. The Court&#8217;s resolution allows the judicial power in a jurisdiction permeable to local political pressures, with serious consequences for the guarantee of rights and access to justice in conditions of equality.
The Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling reinforces the interpretation that the Buenos Aires City Supreme Court can review national cases. This decision sets a better institutional precedent and  allows cases such as that of Correo Argentino SA to be redirected through local channels , facilitating  forum shopping  practices. Various organizations and specialized media have denounced the regressiveness of this measure. There was also a strong  institutional pronouncement : judges, prosecutors, chamber members and  unions  have massively opposed the measure.
The decision is particularly concerning considering that the courts in Buenos Aires City have a  record of using the judicial system to restrict civil society and opposition voices. The Buenos Aires City justice system has historically been involved in defending the use of cyberpatrols . The ruling affects equity in access to justice, weakening fundamental rights such as due process and judicial independence. For CSOs, it implies the risk that key causes – linked to labor, economic or social rights – will be defined in politically aligned courts, without the minimum guarantees of impartiality. It also allows local courts to impose de facto judicial reforms, without public discussion or democratic representation. This weakens the capacity of civil society to influence the rules of the institutional game and limits control over decisions that affect fundamental rights. Public confidence in the impartiality of the judicial system may deteriorate, and the risk of political instrumentalization of justice is critically increased.
Civil society demands legislative action on this judicial transfer and will document the impact of Levinas jurisprudence on sensitive cases and organize public awareness campaigns on the consequences of the ruling. Actions of CSOs &#8211; mainly trade union organizations and organizations of lawyers and magistrates &#8211; need to be reinforced.

"Increasing violence against social leaders in Colombia","Event Summary
In the first half of 2025, Colombia has seen a sustained increase in homicides and threats targeting social leaders, Human Rights Defenders, and Peace Agreement signatories. According to the research institute Indepaz, dozens of murders have been documented in the first half of the year, with four social leaders killed in August 2025 alone. These attacks are occurring in regions marked by armed group fragmentation, illegal economies, and weak state protection, particularly in Cauca, Nariño, and Chocó. The violence includes massacres and targeted assaults that disrupt community organising and collective processes, undermining local leadership and access to essential services. The lack of effective state response continues to erode trust and shrinks civic space, threatening social participation and community resilience. The persistent and targeted nature of the violence poses serious risks to the enabling environment for civil society. Continued monitoring is essential, alongside advocacy for stronger protection mechanisms and accountability.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia and other international organizations have echoed concerns over the escalating violence. Civil society organizations have condemned the killings and called for urgent, coordinated action to protect defenders, verify incidents, and support victims and their families.

"Government Commits to Energy Transition Plan Following Boyacá Protests","Event Summary
On 7 August 2025, after four days of sustained protest, the National Government, Governor Carlos Amaya, the National Mining Agency (ANM), and sector leaders convened a dialogue table in Paipa, Boyacá. The outcome was a government commitment to an energy transition plan for small-scale coal mining, including tax exemptions, debt relief, royalty reviews, technical follow-up, and access to international markets.
This agreement followed intense and widespread strike that began on 4 August 2025, when small coal miners and peasant producers—mainly of potatoes and onions—blocked strategic roads across Boyacá, including Bogotá–Tunja–Paipa–Sogamoso–Ubaté–Ventaquemada and the Boyacá Bridge. Protesters demanded fulfillment of previous agreements, fair pricing, moorland delimitation, and support in transitioning to sustainable energy practices. Their blockades disrupted transport, canceled a stage of the Tour of Colombia, and caused daily economic losses of up to 6,000 million pesos, with food prices rising over 40% in regions like Valle del Cauca.
This event marks a significant advocacy win for just climate transition activists and socioeconomic rights defenders. The Government’s commitment—announced on following four days of protest reflects a direct response to civil society and advocacy pressure. It signals progress in state responsiveness and openness to civil society engagement. The strike, led by grassroots actors, exposed systemic gaps in economic sustainability and institutional support for rural producers and artisanal miners, reinforcing the critical role of civil society in shaping inclusive energy transition policies.

"Confiscation of savings of imprisoned Tajikistani Journalist","Event Summary
On 7 August 2025, the First Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Court of Tajikistan, Shavkat Lutfullozoda, confirmed at a press conference that the bank savings of Rukhshona Khakimova, a 31-year-old imprisoned journalist and mother of two young children, were confiscated by the state. 
The journalist was sentenced in February 2025 to eight years in prison for “high treason” under the high-profile “coup case”. According to her relatives, the  amount confiscated was approximately 230.000 Somoni (21.000 Euros), which she has been saving to buy a house. Authorities did not disclose the official amount. The confiscation is part of broader punitive measures imposed on defendants in the case which also involved well-known public and political figures and former security officers.
The verdict against the journalist sparked significant public outcry in Tajikistan and internationally, with numerous calls from civil society, journalists, international organizations and the UN Special Rapporteur urging a review or reversal of her sentence. To date, the authorities have not responded to these appeals.

"Creation of Federal Constabulary threatens fundamental freedoms","Event Summary
On 14th July 2025, the Government of Pakistan announced the creation of a new nationwide Federal Constabulary, evolving from the historic Frontier Constabulary (FC) under amendments to the 1915 Act. This newly structured force will operate under federal control with the mandate to carry out internal security, riot control, disaster response, and counter-terrorism duties across all provinces and regions, including Islamabad, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Officers from the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) will command the force, and recruitment will occur at a national scale. The legal basis for this transformation is being enacted through a presidential ordinance, bypassing broader parliamentary scrutiny.
The official justification for this restructuring is the need for a rapid, centralized response force to manage diverse emergencies such as civil unrest, natural disasters, and terrorism. However, the announcement has raised serious concerns among civil society, opposition leaders, and rights groups, especially given the timing just weeks before mass protests planned by the opposition PTI on August 5, 2025. Although the Federal Constabulary was eventually not deployed during the August 5 protests, the concentration of force at the federal level raises fears of bypassing provincial autonomy and increasing militarized responses to civilian protests.
Human rights defenders have also flagged risks related to accountability, oversight, and transparency. With paramilitary forces historically associated with abuses in restive regions like Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the expansion of their jurisdiction without public consultation or parliamentary debate is seen as a dangerous precedent. Civil liberties advocates warn that in the absence of independent oversight, the Federal Constabulary could function as a centralized political police, undermining Pakistan’s constitutional protections related to peaceful assembly, freedom of expression, and provincial governance.
While the government frames the new force as a pragmatic solution to complex national threats, its creation reflects a deeper shift toward centralized, militarized governance in Pakistan. The bypassing of democratic processes and the potential misuse of this force in quelling dissent raise alarming questions about the future of civil liberties, provincial autonomy, and democratic accountability in the country. The move is not only a legal and administrative change, it is a stark signal of the government’s intent to restructure security architecture in ways that may erode the already fragile space for democratic dissent.

"Mass convictions of opposition party supporters has chilling effect on civil society","Event Summary
The conviction of 108 members of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) by an anti-terrorism court in Faisalabad on July 31, 2025, marks one of the most significant judicial actions against a political party in Pakistan’s recent history. These individuals were found guilty in connection with the May 9, 2023 riots, which broke out nationwide after Khan was arrested on corruption charges. While the protests began as peaceful demonstrations, they quickly escalated into violence, with attacks on military and government buildings, including the Lahore Corps Commander House, triggering a massive security response. The state accused PTI of orchestrating the violence and used anti-terrorism laws to pursue hundreds of its members. The court’s decision handed 10-year sentences to top leaders like Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz, while others received sentences ranging from one to three years.
This mass sentencing has deepened Pakistan’s political crisis, especially since it comes at a time when PTI has been under consistent pressure from both the judiciary and the military establishment. Despite winning the most seats in the February 2024 general elections, PTI was blocked from forming a government, which many observers attribute to backchannel interference by the establishment. Since then, the party has been subjected to what it calls a “legal onslaught,” with its workers and leaders facing arrests, disqualifications, asset seizures, and travel bans. The timing of this verdict just days ahead of the August 5 protest movement, marking two years since Khan’s detention, is widely seen as an attempt to preempt public mobilization and demoralize party supporters by removing key leadership from the political arena. Despite the July 31 convictions and a ban on public gatherings under Section 144, PTI supporters staged rallies in major cities including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Karachi, and Islamabad. Police responded with baton charges and tear gas, detaining more than 240 activists nationwide, with over 200 arrests reported in Lahore alone.
Human rights organizations have raised serious concerns about the fairness of the trial process against the 108 PTI members, citing closed hearings, limited access to legal counsel, and the use of military and anti-terror courts to try civilians. The application of anti-terrorism laws to political protests is being condemned as a dangerous precedent that criminalizes dissent and could be used against other opposition voices in the future. Civil society actors also worry that this strategy is contributing to a larger trend of democratic backsliding, where courts and security agencies are increasingly used as tools of political engineering rather than neutral institutions.
The PTI leadership has vowed to appeal the verdicts, while also calling for peaceful resistance and parliamentary protests. However, given the shrinking space for protest, speech, and association, the options for political expression are rapidly narrowing. These mass convictions may have an immediate chilling effect on political activity, but they are also likely to fuel long-term instability, resentment, and further erosion of public trust in democratic institutions especially among the youth and urban middle class that form the PTI’s core support base. This moment is emblematic of Pakistan’s current struggle between authoritarian control and democratic resistance, with the judiciary now positioned at the heart of that conflict.

"Government Reissues License to Truth Media Group After Civil Society Pressure in Sierra Leone","Event Summary
On 20 August 2025, Truth Media resumed radio broadcasting and released its first newspaper edition after the Government of Sierra Leone reissued its license and frequency. This reversal followed intense and sustained advocacy by the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists (SLAJ), which engaged government agencies to uphold media freedom and democratic principles. The reissuance marks a significant win for civil society, demonstrating the power of collective pressure in defending the right to free expression. SLAJ’s intervention was widely supported by media stakeholders and human rights defenders, who viewed the initial license withdrawal—made abruptly on the eve of Truth Media’s launch in July 2025—as a troubling sign.
While Truth Media is now operational, concerns remain. G8 Media Group, despite meeting all licensing requirements, continues to await approval. However, the reissuing of Trust Media license demonstrates signs of a responsive shift in government behavior under public and institutional advocacy. It reflects progress in the protection of media freedom and signals the potential for constructive engagement between civil society and state institutions.

"Courtroom Clash Over Free Speech: Pakistan Suspends Ban on 27 YouTube Channels Amid Censorship Controversy","Event Summary
In early July 2025, a judicial magistrate in Islamabad ordered YouTube to block 27 Pakistani channels, including those run by journalists, political commentators, and opposition supporters. The order was based on a June 2 report by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), which accused these channels of spreading “anti-state” and misleading content. The directive included prominent names such as Asad Ali Toor, Matiullah Jan, and supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan. Following this, YouTube sent warnings to the affected content creators, stating that their channels could be blocked in Pakistan if they did not comply with local laws.
However, this move sparked a significant backlash from journalists, civil society, and digital rights advocates who viewed it as a violation of freedom of speech and a dangerous overreach of judicial power. Critics, including the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), warned that such blanket bans without due process could set a precedent for widespread censorship. They emphasized that targeting entire channels instead of individual posts infringes upon democratic norms and the constitutional right to free expression, especially at a time when other media avenues are already restricted.
Responding to the backlash, an Islamabad Additional District and Sessions Court suspended the ban on 11 July 2025, for some of the petitioners, including Toor and Jan. The court noted that the original order lacked proper jurisdiction and had procedural flaws. Within a few days, the suspension was extended to five more YouTubers, with more hearings scheduled for July 21. The court’s intervention has temporarily halted the blocking of the channels, but the broader legal and political debate over digital censorship in Pakistan remains unresolved.

"Tanzania bars foreigners from 15 business sectors including media ownership","Event Summary
On 30 July 2025, Industry and Trade Minister Selemani Jafo announced a ban on non-citizens engaging in 15 business categories under the Business Licensing (Prohibition of Business Activities for Non-Citizens) Order, 2025. The move aims to protect local entrepreneurs and address rising unemployment, following public concern over foreign traders, particularly in areas like Kariakoo. Banned activities include retail and wholesale trade (except supermarkets), small-scale mining, mobile money services, media ownership, gambling outside casinos, tour guiding, real estate brokerage, and clearing and forwarding. Licensing authorities have been instructed not to issue or renew permits for non-citizens in these sectors.
This announcement follows growing debate in Tanzania over the role of foreign nationals in small- and medium-scale business sectors traditionally dominated by local traders. In areas like Kariakoo, local business owners have voiced concerns that an influx of foreign traders—particularly from neighboring countries—has intensified competition, reduced profit margins, and contributed to rising unemployment among Tanzanians. However, critics warn that while the intent is commendable, the measure could also create diplomatic tensions—particularly with countries whose nationals have been active in the affected sectors.
Restricting foreign participation in these sectors especially in areas like media ownership could raise concerns about media pluralism, diversity of voices, and the openness of the business environment. Such restrictions might also limit cross-border investment and collaboration opportunities for CSOs, particularly those working with regional and international partners.

"Querella penal contra organizaciones defensoras del ambiente.","Event Summary
On 7 August 2025,  a criminal complaint  was filed on behalf of a Puerto Barú Project developer against two environmental organizations: Centro de Incidencia ambiental and Adopta Bosque Panamá. The complaint is based on the alleged commission of the crimes of slander and libel, as well as crimes against the national economy, in the context of the organisations’ public opposition to the port project. In September 2024, both organizations were part of actors who had filed lawsuits before the Supreme Court of Justice against the environmental impact studies for the Puerto Barú project, alleging violations of current environmental regulations. These legal actions remain pending before the Supreme Court, with no final ruling issued.
This use of judicial system as a mechanism of intimidation against media outlets, environmental defenders, and organised communities is a concern for the enabling environment of civil society.  It sends a chilling effect, promoting self-censorship among other civil society actors who, fearing legal retaliation, may refrain from exercising their right to participation, assembly, and expression.

"Levée de la réserve algérienne sur l’article 15(4) de la CEDAW","Event Summary
On 4 August 2025,  Algeria lifted, by Presidential Decree No. 25-218, its reservation to Article 15(4) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), a provision guaranteeing women and men equal rights in terms of freedom of movement and choice of residence and domicile. The decree was published in the Official Gazette No. 55 of 17 August 2025. This decision ends a reservation made upon accession in 1996 and is now considered irrelevant in view of legislative developments, in particular the reform of the Family Code in 2005.
Algeria acceded to CEDAW in 1996 with several reservations, including those related to Article 15(4). Since then, a gradual process of adjustment has been underway including reform of the Nationality Code in 2005 allowing the transmission of nationality through the mother and, more broadly, revisions to the Family Code. The withdrawal of the reservation on Article 15(4) is a further step in this direction. Legally, Article 15 enshrines women&#8217;s equality in terms of civil capacity and equality in the free choice of residence and domicile. In practical terms, the lifting of the reservation clarifies the State&#8217;s international commitment and removes a contradiction in principle between the United Nation&#8217;s (UN) framework and domestic law as currently interpreted. It also comes at a time when public debate is polarised on women&#8217;s rights; the government presents the measure as &#8220;technical&#8221;, while some actors see it as a step forward and others fear cultural &#8220;alignment&#8221;. In any case, publication in the Official Journal makes the decision enforceable and paves the way for formal notification to the UN Secretary-General.
This event is part of an existing pattern of mainly symbolic &#8220;small steps&#8221; that externalises compliance at the international level while postponing structural reforms. To break with this pattern, the State should publish a legislative timetable, lift all remaining reservations and engage in a participatory process to review discriminatory provisions, with guarantees against backsliding.

"Sabah Student Activist Abdul Qayyum Arrested Under Sedition Act Over Comment on Governor, Released Without Charge","Event Summary
On 21 August 2025, Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) student Abdul Qayyum was arrested at his home by police who arrived in two cars and one motorcycle. He was taken alone to the Kota Kinabalu district police headquarters without legal counsel present. Police confiscated his mobile phone and SIM card, informing him that his statement would be recorded but not clarifying his detention status. 
Qayyum was investigated under Section 4(1) of the Sedition Act over a comment he posted on Sabah Governor Musa Aman’s Facebook page. The comment, made under a post on Musa’s page about an award ceremony and later deleted, criticised the governor over perceived inaction regarding the highly publicised Zara Qairina case. He was detained for close to five hours and questioned, with the investigating officer initially indicating a possible court remand the next day. However, Qayyum was released without charge later that night, though his phone remains under police custody.
Qayyum’s arrest cannot be separated from Sabah’s heightened sensitivities around public criticism of its political leadership. His Facebook comment targeting Governor Musa Aman came less than a year after graphic artist and activist Fahmi Reza was arrested and deported from Kota Kinabalu for publicly displaying a caricature of Musa in December 2024. Fahmi’s action triggered more than 30 police reports and public condemnation from Sabah-based organisations, including veterans’ groups, political parties, and NGOs, who claimed the caricature insulted the state’s Yang di-Pertua Negeri and undermined social harmony. Some demanded that Fahmi be barred from entering Sabah, while others emphasised that only Sabahans had the “right” to criticise Sabah leaders, framing outsiders’ criticism as a form of intrusion.
Qayyum’s arrest makes him the third university student activist this year to be arrested under the Sedition Act. Earlier, Fadhil Kasim and Aliff Danial Badrul Akmal Hisham—both coordinators of the Gempur Rasuah Sabah 2.0 protest—were arrested alongside fellow activist Sabir Syarafuddin after torching a caricature of the Prime Minister during the rally. In all three cases, students were subjected to arrest rather than voluntary questioning, underscoring the criminalising of dissent through a colonial-era law.
This backlash highlights how criticism of Musa Aman has been politicised as both an insult to the governor’s office and, by extension, to Sabah’s dignity and unity. It also reflects a broader culture where political sensitivities are amplified by appeals to local identity and loyalty to state institutions. This sits within a longer trajectory of Sedition Act misuse against activists.

"Citizen referendumin Colombia seeks to overturn the Final Peace Agreement with the FARC","Event Summary
On 22 August 2025, the Colombian National Registry admitted the registration of a citizens&#8217; committee promoting a referendum to &#8220;repeal the 2016 Peace Agreement&#8221; between the Colombian State and the FARC, as well as the Total Peace Law (Law 2272 of 2022) relating to the framework for ongoing negotiations. To be implemented, this mechanism requires the collection of signatures equivalent to 5% of the electoral roll to activate the popular vote.
This transformation would affect the current legislation of the agreement which has been incorporated into two legislative acts (1 and 2 of 2017), six statutory laws and 35 decrees, with constitutional, jurisprudential and international treaty backing and consolidating it as part of the constitutional bloc — and therefore considered inviolable. President Petro has warned that endorsing repeal via referendum would be a breach of Colombia&#8217;s international commitments, with possible diplomatic sanctions. The final peace agreement includes not only the former FARC but also various sectors of Colombian society and communities in territories with a history of economic and social vulnerability.
There is polarisation at the national level over the implementation of the Final Peace Agreement, which from the outset was expressed  by the victory of the “No” vote in the 2016 referendum. Some sectors of the political right have spoken out over the years against this agreement and its implementation, including the previous government of Iván Duque (2018-2022). The initiative comes at an election time and could contribute to further polarising the democratic environment.

"Murder of social leader Álvaro Roncancio","Event Summary
On 15 August 2025,  Álvaro Roncancio Aguirre, president of the Community Action Board of the Tenjo district in Palmira (Valle del Cauca), was murdered at the age of 64. The attack took place on Bulevar de la Carbonera, in the Zamorano neighbourhood, when Roncancio was travelling in his vehicle and was approached by hitmen who shot him multiple times. He was taken to a medical centre, where he died from his injuries.
Roncancio had already received death threats and was displaced along with his family from the rural area from early 2025 as a result of pressure from illegal armed groups. The Ombudsman&#8217;s Office had issued early warnings (AT 019 of 2023 and AT 010 of 2024) about the serious risk faced by social leaders in Palmira. Palmira and the Tenjo district have been identified as high-risk areas due to the presence of illegal armed groups—such as FARC dissidents (&#8220;Adán Izquierdo&#8221;) and the 57th Front &#8220;Yair Bermúdez&#8221;—and deficiencies in effective state protection schemes.
The crime occurs in a context of increasing violence against social leaders in Colombia where more than 100 have been killed in 2025 thus far and unfortunately, is expected to continue. Roncancio is the 101st murder of a social leader in 2025.

"Formal definition of “Peace Regions” by the Government","Event Summary
In late August 2025, the Colombian Government, under the framework of its Total Peace policy (Law 2272 of 2022), has made progress in defining the operational and regulatory aspects of the &#8220;Peace Regions&#8220;. The &#8220;Peace Regions&#8221; are a concept that has been under consideration since 2022 but still lack a formal, consolidated framework. Progress has recently been made in the discussion of a draft government decree establishing criteria, procedures and monitoring mechanisms to make this concept an effective tool.
The &#8220;Peace Regions&#8221; are strategic areas prioritised for promoting humanitarian dialogue and comprehensive state action. Within these regions, Priority Intervention Zones may be established, where coordinated interventions by the state and communities will be concentrated. The initiative is part of a vision of a territorial peace policy, seeking to move beyond centralised models in order to act in a differentiated manner according to the reality of each region affected by the conflict.
The operational core of the initiative is the &#8220;Peace Models,&#8221; territorial action plans developed jointly by the Presidential Council for Peace and the National Planning Department (DNP). These instruments seek to coordinate public investment with the active participation of ethnic groups, social organisations, and local communities. The results of these negotiation processes have been limited and have been criticised by various social sectors and human rights defenders, given the escalation of violence currently experienced by the country in some territories. However, the regions are committed to strengthening institutional presence in vulnerable areas.

"Constitutional amendment enhances public participation and the role of civil society","Event Summary
On 13 August 2025, Lesotho adopted the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution Act, 2025, with several provisions that directly affect Civil Society Organisations (CSOs).
The constitutional amendment introduces a new section 22A that directly empowers individuals acting in the public interest, or associations acting on behalf of their members or society, to approach competent courts for appropriate relief when a constitutional right is infringed or threatened. This provision significantly enhances the legal standing and capacity of CSOs to engage in public interest litigation. This fundamentally alters the policy landscape by lowering barriers to justice and strengthening the principle of rule of law and access to legal remedies. For instance, CSOs can now more readily initiate legal challenges on behalf of marginalised groups or the environment, enhancing their role as watchdogs and advocates.
The Constitutional Amendment Act also reconstitutes the Human Rights Commission, granting it a higher degree of independence from the executive branch of Government. The Commission’s functions include promoting and protecting human rights, monitoring their state, and investigating alleged violations. Its composition is intended to be representative of a broad cross-section of society, including women, people with disabilities, youth, and other marginalised groups, which aligns with the advocacy focus of many CSOs. Similarly, the Lesotho Independent Anti-Corruption and Ethics Commission is also given more independence from the Executive, bolstering efforts in areas CSOs often monitor.
The constitutional amendment further introduces a new section on the media sector, outlining general principles that recognise the media’s integral role in democratisation and development, including its function in facilitating citizen participation in public affairs. Importantly, the Media Council of Lesotho, established as an independent body to regulate the media industry, will comprise persons from various sectors, explicitly including civil society and human rights, which provides CSOs with a direct formal role in media governance in Lesotho.
The Act also outlines principles for state institutions that strengthen constitutional democracy, affirming their independence, impartiality, and accountability to Parliament. Furthermore, principles governing public administration now explicitly include encouraging public participation in policy-making and ensuring responsiveness to people’s needs, directly endorsing a key function of CSOs in promoting inclusive governance.
To ensure the Amendment delivers real democratic gains, CSOs should push for prompt enactment of enabling legislation for Section 22A, advocate for independent and representative appointments to the Human Rights Commission and the Anti-Corruption and Ethic Commission, secure meaningful representation in the Media Council of Lesotho, and demand the development of concrete mechanisms for consultation

"Constitutional reform to eliminate presidential term limits approved with no public scrutiny","Event Summary
On 1 August 2025, El Salvador&#8217;s Legislative Assembly, dominated by President Nayib Bukele’s New Ideas party, approved a constitutional reform eliminating presidential term limits, enabling the president to seek re-election indefinitely. The reform also extends presidential terms from five to six years.
This change was passed rapidly and without public consultation or meaningful legislative debate. The vote occurred just one day before the August holidays, a tactic increasingly used to pass major reforms when public scrutiny is minimal. Civil society organisations and citizens were not informed or given the opportunity to weigh in.
This marks the second major constitutional change in 2025 alone, continuing a pattern of consolidating power with no public participation. Earlier reforms in January were similarly rushed and approved without public input or parliamentary scrutiny, even targeting constitutional articles considered non-amendable. The repeated disregard for democratic processes and civic engagement represents a serious erosion of state openness and responsiveness to civil society.

"Bill on prosecution of criminal organisations, with guarantees of victim participation","Event Summary
On 20 July 2025, the Ministry of Justice submitted a bill to the Congress of the Republic, within the framework of the Total Peace policy. This bill aims to define a clear legal framework for the demobilisation and prosecution of illegal groups, including non-political criminal gangs such as the Clan del Golfo, with an emphasis on protecting the rights of victims and their right to participation, to which a specific chapter (Chapter II) is dedicated. On 19 August 2025, the process formally began in the first committee. After the presentation of the report, the proposal will continue its passage through Congress; a process that will need to pass four debates, two in the Chamber and two more in the Senate for it to become a law of the Republic.
This bill is part of the current government&#8217;s Total Peace policy (Law 2272 of 2022), which is a key element in advancing the enabling environment for civil society by contributing to spaces for participation and ending the conflict, which is one of the main threats to consolidating an open civic space in the country. The bill is based on the Victims Act, which has been in force in Colombia since 2011 and has made victims of the conflict key players in civil society.
While progress since 2022, when the Total Peace Law was defined, has been gradual and scattered, it is expected to continue advancing in the future.

"Call for public input for amending the Online Safety Act","Event Summary
On 13 August 2025, the Ministry of Justice of Sri Lanka invited the general public, including both local and international media organizations, to submit their observations, comments, recommendations, and suggestions regarding the proposed amendments to the Online Safety Act No. 09 of 2024 (hereinafter referred to as &#8216;the Act&#8217; or &#8216;OSA&#8217;).
Members of the public have been granted a period of one month from 13 August 2025 to submit their inputs.
This development follows a decision of the Cabinet of Ministers, pursuant to which the Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs appointed a committee to review the Act and the amendments published in the Gazette on July 31, 2024. The committee has been mandated to conduct public consultations prior to finalizing its recommendations.
This initiative is regarded as a significant opportunity for diverse stakeholders, including human rights activists, journalists, media professionals, subject experts, and civil society at large, to provide constructive feedback on a law that has frequently been criticized for being misused since its enactment.
If implemented in earnest, the government is expected to not only take into account the feedback received but also to facilitate further consultations. Such an approach would contribute to shaping the amendments to the Act while simultaneously upholding best practices in participatory governance through public consultation.

"Arrest of protesters in The Gambia","Event Summary
On 22 August 2025, the Gambian police arrested at least 23 protesters demonstrating against the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority’s (PURA) controversial decision to impose a price floor on mobile data. The move, which critics say protects mobile service companies at the expense of consumers, effectively ended competitive pricing that had previously lowered internet costs. Protesters argued the regulation undermines market competition and consumer welfare.
The arrested youths were brought before the Kanifing Magistrate Court, which denied them bail and ordered their remand at Mile Two Central Prison until the next hearing on 4 September.
The arrests raise concerns regarding the government’s response to public dissent, weakening citizens’ ability to hold regulators and government accountable on issues that directly affect their rights and livelihoods

"Civic space closing and civil society actors forced into exile","Event Summary
Since the Foreign Agents Law was approved and came into force in June 2025, civil society actors are increasingly being forced into exile to avoid arbitrary arrest and persecution.  In May and June alone, dozens of journalists fled the country, joining an expanding wave of exiled civil society actors. Cristosal—a leading human rights organisation—also announced on 17 July 2025 that it is suspending operations in El Salvador and relocating to Guatemala, citing escalating repression and a deliberate strategy of exemplary punishment by the state. They mentioned that the arrest of their colleague Ruth López, is not an isolated case but part of a broader strategy of exemplary punishment meant for intimidations of civil society actors. This was also followed by another arrest of a constitutional lawyer Enrique Anaya who had criticised the arrest of López.
These developments underscore the rapidly shrinking enabling environment for civil society in El Salvador, as the new law is silencing critical voices and dismantling independent oversight. With civil society actors forced to close down or into exile, citizens are left increasingly vulnerable to unchecked state power.

"National Assembly passes law imposing new restrictions on CSOs","Event Summary
On 26 August 2025, the National Assembly approved the draft Organic Law on Social Transparency (previously called the Organic Law for the Control of Irregular Capital Flows). Although some changes were made to the proposal, the law retains the main provisions that raised concerns within civil society at the time of its introduction: oversight by a government entity of an economic-productive nature, mandatory compliance with information transparency mechanisms that are disproportionate to the law’s purported objective (the control of money laundering), and the dissolution of organisations justified on grounds of ambiguous interpretation. In addition, a mechanism was introduced that seeks to categorise CSOs according to their assessed level of risk based on criteria such as annual budget and declared assets, the organisation’s purpose, the origin of its funds, number of beneficiaries, and achieved results, among others. Organisations considered “high-risk” will be subject to greater scrutiny by the regulatory authorities. President Noboa has 60 days to issue the general regulations, which will provide further details regarding the law’s implementation.
As previously expressed by civil society actors and the United Nations system, this law represents a potential risk to freedom of expression and association, and its rationale attempts—without evidence—to link civil society to criminal activities and political destabilisation. While all CSOs are at risk, it is expected that the law will have the most negative impact on local, environmental, and indigenous peoples’ rights organisations.
Civil society organisations have not yet commented on the version of the law that was ultimately approved.

"Former president of indigenous movement denounces surveillance and attempt on his life","Event Summary
On 18 August 2025, Leonidas Iza, former president of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE), reported that intelligence agents in an unmarked vehicle carried out surveillance recordings of his home in the community of San Ignacio, Cotopaxi province; according to his testimony, the agents also attempted to take his life. Hours after the incident, members of the community detained three of the agents involved, confiscated their mobile phones, and initiated an indigenous justice process. Messages found on the devices allegedly point to systematic surveillance of Iza and other, as yet unidentified, individuals, with some conversations even mentioning plans to “make Iza disappear.” While the content of the messages has not yet been independently verified, the Indigenous movement has announced that this evidence will be submitted to the Office of the Attorney General (FGE) in the coming days.
The FGE issued a statement confirming that the agents had been conducting activities related to an ongoing investigation, a claim denied by the detained agents during the indigenous justice hearing. Carolina Jaramillo, spokesperson for the National Government, declined to comment on the case; however, she indicated that Iza will be charged with the crime of kidnapping the three agents involved.
Given the current national context, this incident may signal the start of intimidation and criminalisation measures targeting the organised Indigenous movement, which has repeatedly expressed its dissatisfaction with the national government. This development not only risks a significant setback in terms of the constitutional right to freedom of association but may also curtail the political participation of Ecuador’s Indigenous peoples and nationalities.
Environmental organisations, activists, and elected authorities have expressed concern over the incident and the government’s treatment of the Indigenous movement.

"Electoral reforms and complaints about the Civic Registry reduce spaces for dialogue and citizen participation in Paraguay ","Event Summary
In Paraguay, recent complaints about irregular transfers in the Permanent Civic Registry (RCP) and reforms to the Electoral Code not only affect the transparency of the electoral process, but also directly limit the enabling environment for civil society. After the 2023 elections, several CSOs were stigmatized as actors of interference and cooperation agreements with the Superior Electoral Court (TSJE) were broken, discouraging new citizen observation initiatives. 
At the same time, Congress passed reforms that eliminate the use of the national registry in primary elections (Legislative file here) and modify provisions on political financing (Legislative file here). While some sectors point out that these reforms &#8220;relax&#8221; controls and open up risks of opacity, the TSJE itself admitted that recommendations to strengthen oversight were ignored. 
At the same time, the debate on the bidding for new voting machines is taking place without including organizations with technical expertise, some of which were publicly identified as opponents of electronic voting. 
These developments reduce the channels of dialogue between citizens and institutions.

"Uganda Parliament reverses Supreme Court ruling by reintroducing civilian trials in military courts","Event Summary
On 20 May 2025, Uganda’s Parliament passed the Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces (Amendment) Bill, 2025, reintroducing provisions that allow military courts to try civilians under certain “military-related” offenses, such as treason, terrorism, or possession of military-grade weapons. The bill also restructures the courts-martial, creates a Directorate of Military Prosecutions, and formalizes the role of the Special Forces Command.
This legislative move directly contradicts the 31 January 2025 Supreme Court ruling (Attorney General vs. Hon. Michael Kabaziguruka), which declared civilian trials in military courts unconstitutional. At the time, this ruling was reported through the EU SEE mechanism as an Improvement Alert (March 2025), highlighting its potential to protect civic freedoms. The new amendment bill, however, reverses that progress.
Civil society and legal actors have already reacted. On 16 June 2025, the Uganda Law Society (ULS) announced its intention to challenge the constitutionality of the UPDF Amendment Act in the Constitutional Court. In its statement, ULS emphasized its long-standing commitment to demilitarization, human rights, separation of powers, and judicial independence.
The law was passed amid political tension in the run-up to the 2026 elections and is widely seen by civil society as a tool to entrench militarization and suppress opposition. Critics warn that it could be used to target political leaders, activists, and journalists under vaguely defined offenses, and to intimidate citizens through restrictions such as banning the use of military attire by civilians. The bill therefore represents a significant deterioration of the enabling environment, undermining judicial independence, reversing previous gains, and increasing the risk of repression in the electoral context.

"Freedom of assembly increasingly impeded in Zimbabwe","Event Summary
On 31st July 2025, the CSO ZimRights held a Stakeholders Engagement Meeting at Gwanda Hotel, which was interrupted by District Administrator Nomathemba Ngwenya and her assistant, Awakhiwe Ndlovu. They summoned the convener and Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) officers outside, explaining that they were acting on instructions from the District Development Coordinator (DDC) to halt the meeting due to non-compliance with local NGO policies. The government has emphasised that NGOs must operate within strict guidelines, often requiring them to establish formal agreements, such as Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs), with local authorities before conducting activities. Ngwenya reprimanded the ZRP for allowing the meeting without appropriate due diligence and stated that only organisations with MOUs with the local authority are permitted to operate in the region, with MOUs established only after a vetting process by the District Joint Operations Committee and local government heads. ZimRights was ordered to conclude the meeting immediately to avoid conflict with the Office of the President and Cabinet (OPC) and was invited to visit the DDC’s office for further clarification on operational requirements for NGOs.
Additionally, in late July 2025, ZimRights held an onboarding meeting in Uzumba Maramba Pfungwe, Mashonaland East. Although the police in Murehwa approved the meeting, attendance was surprisingly low. Initially, 50 people were expected, but only 10 showed up. This drop in attendance was due to fear among villagers, especially from Mutata, who were hesitant to join NGO-organised events. Many potential attendees reported being discouraged by traditional and political leaders, who often seek information about such meetings.
Similarly, ZimRights faced bureaucratic challenges during an onboarding meeting in Muzarabani, Mashonaland Central, needing to consult with police in both Guruve and Muzarabani. Although many people attended, the atmosphere was filled with excessive questioning and red tape. It became clear that without a formal agreement under the Private Voluntary Organisations (PVO) Act, the meeting likely would not have been allowed. Such practices not only hinder the work of civil society but also show the obstacles they face in these areas.
The influence of a particular political party has made police cautious, making them reluctant to approve civil society activities without knowing about them first. This situation raises serious concerns about the shrinking civic space, as the rights to assemble and express oneself are increasingly being restricted.

"Students suspended for speaking out and demonstrating","Event Summary
In recent developments, seven students from the University of Zimbabwe (UZ), affiliated with the Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU), have faced suspension on allegations of participating in demonstrations advocating for equitable remuneration for lecturers. Similarly, at Great Zimbabwe University (GZU), three students were suspended for expressing concerns regarding the competency of the Dean of Students within a WhatsApp group, raising significant questions about academic freedom and freedom of expression.
Furthermore, five students at Midlands State University (MSU) were also recently suspended, accused of engaging in recruitment activities aimed at persuading freshmen to join ZINASU. These incidents collectively illustrate a troubling trend: the systematic erosion of civic space within these institutions and the operating environment for civic movements in Zimbabwe.
The actions taken against these students not only contravene their rights to free expression and assembly but also highlight a broader institutional effort to stifle dissent and suppress the voices of those who seek to advocate for their rights and the rights of their peers. Such measures represent a significant violation of fundamental freedoms enshrined in both national and international legal frameworks.
The implications of these suspensions extend beyond individual cases; they signify a chilling effect on student activism and an alarming compromise of the democratic principles that should underpin higher education institutions. As universities grapple with the role of student organizations, it is imperative that they uphold the principles of academic freedom and protect the rights of students to engage in open discourse without fear of reprisal.

"Police Brutality: Riots in Jakarta Protests Marked by Tragic Death of Demonstrators","Event Summary
In late August 2025, widespread protests erupted in Jakarta and other major Indonesian cities, triggered by outrage over lawmakers’ new housing allowances of 50 million rupiah per month (≈USD 3,000) – nearly ten times the Jakarta minimum wage – amid austerity and a state budget deficit. Reports on the allowances sparked anger among students, workers, and activists, who denounced “corrupt elites” and demanded accountability.
On 25 August 2025, thousands attempted to breach barriers near Parliament, clashing with over 1,200 police officers who fired tear gas and water cannons. Protests soon widened to oppose cuts in education funding, President Prabowo Subianto’s costly free school meals program, and the expanded military role in civilian governance.
The crisis escalated on 28 August 2025 when Affan Kurniawan, a ride-hailing driver, was fatally struck by a police tactical vehicle, as confirmed by Tempo, Reuters, and ABS-CBN. His funeral was attended by hundreds of drivers in solidarity. The Jakarta Legal Aid Institute reported 600 detentions, half of them minors, condemning mass arrests and excessive police force.
President Prabowo expressed condolences and ordered the arrest of seven officers involved. However, dismissive comments from parliamentarians, including House Speaker Puan Maharani defending the allowances, further inflamed public distrust.
With austerity cuts, 13% youth unemployment, and the revised Armed Forces Law expanding military authority, these developments not only undermine freedoms of assembly and expression but also intimidate citizens, creating a hostile environment for civil society engagement. They also reveal distorted resource allocation—prioritizing perks for legislators over investment in civil society and public services—further constraining the enabling environment. Civil society is demanding systemic reforms in governance, fiscal accountability, and human rights protections. This includes independent probes into police brutality, reforms to crowd-control practices, and heightened scrutiny of parliamentary perks.

"The Role of Civil Society in Chile’s Accession to the EITI Standard","Event Summary
For several years, different civil society organizations advocated for Chile’s accession to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). However, it was not until late 2023 that the Chilean Copper Commission (Cochilco) was formally designated by the Government as the Technical Secretariat responsible for coordinating the application process. Following this step and the Government’s commitment to join the initiative, around 30 civil society organizations self-organized into a working group to align objectives and coordinate their participation.
On 16 December 2024, under Cochilco’s leadership, the Multi-Stakeholder Group (MSG) was officially established, bringing together representatives from government, civil society, and the mining industry. Its mandate included drafting operating bylaws and developing the Work Plan required for Chile’s EITI application. As a result, on 19 August 2025, the Government of Chile formally submitted its candidacy to the EITI.
As a result, on 19 August 2025, the Government of Chile formally submitted its candidacy to the EITI. This milestone represents a significant step toward transparency and accountability in strategic sectors such as copper and lithium, through a tripartite dialogue mechanism. Approval of the application is expected to consolidate this multi-stakeholder process and strengthen governance in the extractive industries.

"India’s 2025 Income Tax Act reshapes NGO regulation and funding environment","Event Summary
On 21 August 2025, India enacted significant reforms to its tax framework when the new Income-Tax Act, 2025 received Presidential assent, replacing the six-decade-old 1961 law. The Act, passed by Parliament earlier in August, consolidates and simplifies provisions but also introduces changes with major implications for NGOs.
Among the most relevant provisions for civil society are the extension of NGO registration validity to ten years, the removal of the 15% mandatory investment rule for unspent income, and the increase of the reporting threshold for “substantial contributions” to ₹1 lakh. These measures reduce bureaucratic hurdles and provide greater financial flexibility, particularly for smaller NGOs. At the same time, the law introduces a flat 5% tax on anonymous donations, while maintaining exemptions for certain religious-cum-charitable trusts, and strengthens audit and oversight requirements. Officials from the Central Board of Direct Taxes have confirmed that new rules and FAQs will be issued by December 2025 to guide implementation.
While these reforms modernise compliance and financial management, concerns remain that grassroots NGOs, particularly those reliant on small or anonymous contributions, may face funding strains and uneven treatment compared to large charitable trusts.

"Myanmar Junta Weaponizes Transport Restrictions to Suppress Opposition","Event Summary
On 27 August 2025, the Burma/Myanmar junta banned the transport of a wide range of goods, including critical medicines, electrical appliances, and consumer products, to multiple states and regions. This policy is an escalation of intensified inspections that began in early August 2025, originating from the major logistics hub of Mandalay. The restricted items are extensive, encompassing everything from feminine hygiene products and mosquito nets to mining equipment and agricultural fertiliser. The ban specifically targets regions with significant opposition control, including parts of Sagaing, Mandalay, and ethnic states like Karen and Kachin. This move is a deliberate strategy to economically stranglehold areas held by Ethnic Resistance Organizations (ERO) and People&#8217;s Defence Forces (PDFs) by severing access to essential supplies, thereby punishing the civilian population and crippling local economies. The junta has enforced this through multi-team inspections at key terminals like Swe Taw and increased checkpoints on all main roads. This sweeping transport ban severely constrains humanitarian access and economic activity in opposition-held regions, further shrinking civic space and undermining the ability of civil society actors to operate or support affected communities.

"President Samia Suluhu Hassan Pledges Stronger Partnership with Civil Society Ahead of Tanzania's 2025 Elections","Event Summary
As Tanzania enters its official election period ahead of the 29 October 2025 General Election, CCM presidential candidate, incumbent president Dr. Samia Suluhu Hassan has placed collaboration with civil society organizations (CSOs) at the heart of her campaign. Launching the ruling party CCM’s campaign on 28 August 2025, Dr. Samia unveiled a 13-point plan for her first 100 days in office if re-elected, including a commitment to strengthen partnerships between government, political stakeholders, CSOs, and the private sector.
Central to this pledge is the proposed establishment of a Commission for Dialogue and Reconciliation, aimed at fostering inclusive national discussions and reinforcing democratic participation. This aligns with her “Four Rs” philosophy—Reconciliation, Resilience, Reform, and Rebuild—and includes a promise to create conditions for drafting a new national constitution, a longstanding demand from political actors and civic groups.
While the campaign also highlights priorities in education, health, employment, and access to clean water, the emphasis on civil society engagement signals potential progress toward a more enabling environment. However, the true impact will depend on implementation and whether these commitments translate into meaningful reforms that protect civic space and promote inclusive governance.

"Recent Acquittals of HRDs Reveal Systemic Use of Lawfare to Suppress Civil Society in Zimbabwe","Event Summary
On 20 August 2025, Zimbabwean civil society briefly celebrated the acquittal of prominent human rights defenders (HRDs) Namatai Kwekweza (Director of WeLead and ZimRights member), Robson Chere (Secretary General of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe) and Samuel Gwenzi (ZimRights member). Their release followed a year-long ordeal that began with their abduction from a plane at Robert Mugabe International Airport in July 2024, towards the convening of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) Summit of Heads of State and Government. The abduction was followed by alleged torture and prolonged detention on charges of “disorderly conduct” linked to a peaceful march outside the Harare Magistrates Court on 27 June 2024. The overwhelming evidence indicating their non-involvement in the alleged activities underscores the violations of their rights to freedom of assembly and expression. Fellow HRDs Last Chifodya and Vusumuzi Moyo have also been acquitted. In a similar trend in acquittals, Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) leader Emmanuel Sitima was also found not guilty by the Harare Magistrate Court. Yet his ordeal left deep scars of the trauma, the enduring physical and psychological toll of harassment.
While acquittals may offer momentary relief to civil society, they do not reflect a genuine shift toward an enabling environment for CSOs. Instead, they reflect a broader trend in Zimbabwe, where HRDs are routinely arrested, subjected to prolonged pretrial detention, and dragged through lengthy trials. Such tactics are less about securing convictions than about intimidating activists, exhausting their resolve, and undermining their work. They expose the Government of Zimbabwe’s systemic use of lawfare to punish dissent using pretrial detention, long and unnecessary trials, which result in acquittals, but not before HRDs are arbitrarily detained, humiliated, and prosecuted, enduring trauma and financial ruin. These outcomes highlight the precarious nature of human rights work in the country, underscoring that structural change is still far from reach.

"Political Parties Dissolution Case referred to Constitutional Court, Marking Key Test for Civic Freedoms in Mali","Event Summary
On 25 August 2025, the Tribunal de la Commune I in Bamako issued a pivotal ruling by ordering a stay of proceedings and referring the case challenging the dissolution of political parties to the Constitutional Court. This decision stands out as the first judicial acknowledgment of the potential unconstitutionality of Decree No. 2025-0339/PT-RM, issued by the transitional authorities on 13 May 2025, which dissolved all political parties and banned their activities nationwide.
The decree, justified by the government as part of political reforms and efforts to “rationalize” the party landscape, followed revisions to the political parties charter and demonstrations by opposition and civil society actors. It was immediately condemned by former political leaders, civil society organizations, and segments of the public, who view it as a direct assault on democratic pluralism and constitutionally protected civil liberties.
In response, a coalition of citizens and lawyers filed multiple appeals before the High Courts of Bamako and the Supreme Court’s Administrative Section. While most lower courts dismissed the appeals, the 25 August ruling marks a significant legal turning point and a rare institutional check on executive overreach.
Civil society actors have welcomed the referral as a critical opportunity to restore constitutional order and protect civic space. However, they remain cautious, emphasising that the broader enabling environment remains fragile, with the Supreme Court still awaiting a formal response from the government. The outcome of this legal process will be a key indicator of the judiciary’s independence and the transitional authorities’ willingness to uphold democratic norms.

"Civil Liberties at Risk? NCRA’s Deadline for National Identity Cards Raises Concerns","Event Summary
The National Civil Registration Authority (NCRA) has, in a press statement, declared a hard deadline of 31 August 2025 for residents, especially citizens, who do not acquire National ID Cards. In a press conference, Director General Mohamed Massaquoi stated that people will be denied access to public services, including banks, unless they possess a valid ID. The Inspector General  (IGP) William Fayia Sellu of the Sierra Leone Police (SLP) and the National Security Coordinator Abdulai Caulker in the Office of National Security (ONS) emphasized they will commence “operation stop and check” for IDs in the streets across the Country. This is a concern for activists and social commentators, including the Chief Executive of the Centre for Human Rights and Development International, Abdul Fatoma, who considers this a violation of human rights and freedoms and against the Constitution of Sierra Leone. To them, restricting the movement of people is unwarranted and makes life more challenging for the ordinary Sierra Leonean.

"Justice Minister Threatens WhatsApp Group Admins Over Corruption Posts, Sparking Fears of Digital Repression in Zimbabwe","Event Summary
On 18 August 2025, Zimbabwe’s Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, Ziyambi Ziyambi, issued a public warning targeting WhatsApp group administrators, declaring they would be held legally accountable under the Cyber and Data Protection Act [Chapter 12:07] for any unverified corruption allegations shared in their groups. He insisted that admins must demand proof before allowing such content and warned of possible arrest and detention for non-compliance.
This directive comes amid a broader trend where social media platforms have become vital tools for exposing corruption and enabling public discourse. Notable scandals—such as the COVID-19 procurement scandal exposed by journalist Hopewell Chin’ono and Al Jazeera’s gold smuggling investigation—first gained traction online, particularly on WhatsApp and Twitter.
Civil society organizations have strongly criticized the minister’s statement, arguing that it imposes an unrealistic burden on ordinary citizens and amounts to state-sanctioned censorship. They warn that this move will chill free expression, discourage whistleblowing, and erode digital civic space, especially in a context where traditional media is already constrained. By criminalizing unverified speech and deputizing citizens to police each other, the government is fostering self-censorship, weakening freedom of association and expression, and shrinking the enabling environment for civil society. This development signals a deepening of digital authoritarianism in Zimbabwe, where online spaces are increasingly surveilled and controlled.

"Cyber Law Weaponized Against Journalist in Sierra Leone, Raising Alarms Over Press Freedom","Event Summary
On 20 August 2025, Thomas Dixon, Editor of New Age Newspaper and Chairman of the Guild of Newspaper Editors, was summoned by Sierra Leone’s Criminal Investigation Department (CID) following a complaint by Chinese-owned Leone Rock Metal Group. The company accused him of cyberbullying and stalking under the Cyber Security and Crime Act (2022), after he published investigative reports alleging corruption and labor violations. Despite the Independent Media Commission (IMC) dismissing the complaint, the company escalated the matter to CID, bypassing media regulation in favour of criminal prosecution. Dixon was interrogated for hours and released on NLe 100,000 bail. Civil society groups, led by the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists (SLAJ), condemned the interrogation as a misuse of cybersecurity legislation warning that vague provisions in the law—particularly around cyberbullying—are being exploited to intimidate and harass journalists and silence critics under the guise of cybersecurity. On 28 August 2025, Shar Maturi, senior reporter at Standard Times Newspaper, was detained by the CID on cyberbullying and stalking allegations—just hours after Thomas Dixon’s release—before being freed following SLAJ-led negotiations. The back-to-back detentions of prominent journalists under the Cyber Security Act have intensified fears of a coordinated effort to criminalize investigative reporting, signaling a dangerous shift toward legal repression that undermines press freedom, weakens institutional accountability, and chills civic space in Sierra Leone. The implications are severe—journalists may self-censor, media independence is undermined, and public access to information is curtailed.

"Strategic moment for CSOs at the XV Summit of the Global Forum on Migration and Development in Riohacha","Event Summary
From 2 to 4 September 2025, Colombia hosted the XV Summit of the Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD) in Riohacha, La Guajira. As president of the GFMD since 2024, the country promotes inclusive migration governance under the slogan &#8220;Regular migration, labor mobility and human rights&#8221;. Delegates from more than 40 countries, international organizations such as IOM and UNHCR, civil society and the private sector participated.
The event emphasized regional cooperation, youth engagement, labor mobility in the context of climate change, and the use of digital tools in migration management. This summit offered a strategic opportunity to strengthen civil society&#8217;s role in migration governance, influence policy, demonstrate its impact, and raise its visibility. It encouraged the Colombian State to adopt a collaborative, rights-based approach, promote safe digital practices, and open advocacy spaces for social organizations. The summit supports the work of organizations assisting migrants and influences both local and bilateral political relations—particularly with Venezuela. Within this framework, the GFMD can contribute to peacebuilding and binational integration, fostering conditions where human mobility is managed with dignity and respect. The challenge will be to ensure that the commitments transcend the summit and translate into stable policies, with effective and sustained participation by civil society.

"Fifth ACTO Summit in Colombia – Progress and Outstanding Gaps","Event Summary
Between 18 and 22 August 2025, Bogotá hosted the Fifth Summit of ACTO Presidents, where eight Amazonian countries renewed commitments on environmental, climate, security, and territorial governance. The resulting Bogotá Declaration builds on the 2023 Belém commitments and strengthens the regional roadmap toward COP30. Notable outcomes include the creation of the Amazonian Mechanism of Indigenous Peoples (MAPI), a formal co-governance body within ACTO, and the agreement to launch the Tropical Forest Fund (TFFF) at COP30 to support forest conservation.
However, a Civil Society Participation Mechanism was omitted—despite support from over 450 organizations. This limits meaningful engagement from civil society actors, which is especially important in countries like Colombia where environmental defenders face serious threats. The failure to declare the Amazon a fossil-fuel-free zone and the exclusion of Afro-descendant communities from decision-making processes further highlight gaps in inclusive governance. While the summit offered symbolic progress, it did not result in structural improvements for civil society participation.

"Government pledges to revive dormant Tripartite Council, signalling potential expansion of civil society participation in Trinidad and Tobago","Event Summary
On 19 June 2025, during Labour Day commemorations, Trinidad and Tobago’s Minister of Labour, Leroy Baptiste, announced the government’s intention to re-establish the National Tripartite Advisory Council (NTAC), a consultative body comprising government, business, and labour unions. Created in 2016 to foster social dialogue, NTAC became dormant after major unions — including the National Trade Union Centre (NATUC), the Joint Trade Union Movement (JTUM), and the Federation of Independent Trade Unions and Non-Governmental Organisations (FITUN) — withdrew in 2021 citing ineffectiveness.
The pledge, part of a broader “Workers’ Agenda,” includes guaranteeing union representation on statutory boards, and a commitment to modernize labour laws.
If implemented transparently and inclusively, the revival of NTAC could mark a structural improvement in the enabling environment, moving civil society participation beyond ad hoc consultations toward a formal and recurring platform for policy dialogue. This could help institutionalize engagement between the state, labour federations such as NATUC, JTUM, and FITUN, and potentially a wider range of CSOs. By rebuilding trust with organized labour, NTAC has the potential to shift civil society’s role from peripheral to institutional, enhance government responsiveness, and increase civil society’s legitimacy and influence in shaping labour, social, and economic reforms.
Skepticism remains high given NTAC’s past failures, and the real impact will depend on whether this new iteration functions consistently and delivers meaningful dialogue. Still, if momentum is sustained, NTAC’s revival could set a precedent for broader participatory reforms and more accountable governance in Trinidad and Tobago.

"Draft NGO Registration, Regulation and Management Bill raises concerns of shrinking civic space in Nepal","Event Summary
In August 2025, Nepal’s Ministry of Home Affairs published a draft NGO Registration, Regulation and Management Bill, consolidating three existing laws governing CSOs: the Associations Registration Act (1977), the National Guidance Act (1961), and the Social Welfare Act (1992). The draft proposes to dissolve the Social Welfare Council and create a new department under direct ministerial control. Critically, regulatory authority would shift from the Ministry of Women, Children, and Senior Citizens to the Ministry of Home Affairs, signaling a move from a welfare-oriented to a security-oriented approach.
The bill was open for public comment for 15 days, with the government framing it as necessary to align with the federal constitution and promote transparency and accountability. However, the NGO Federation of Nepal (NFN), after urgent consultations, has denounced the draft as regressive, restricting freedom of association and shrinking civic space. NFN’s press release highlights problematic provisions on registration, renewal, and oversight.

"Jordan's Muslim Brotherhood Association disbands itself","Event Summary
On 22 July 2025, the Muslim Brotherhood Association voted to disband itself and announced this through an issued statement. The statement affirmed the organization’s national loyalty and belonging, and distanced itself from its name and its connotations.
The Muslim Brotherhood Association was classified as an ‘association’, and therefore represented a legally-recognized entity associated with the Jordan Brotherhood. However, the association was considered more further removed from the grassroots Brotherhood membership that belonged to the Muslim Brotherhood parent group, which was banned by the government in April 2025. The disbanding of this association represents another closure of a Brotherhood-affiliated entity.

On 24 July 2025, Ayman Abli was detained by the Cybercrime Unit (the entity associated with implementing the 2023 Cybercrime Law) over Instagram content for “publishing content that may incite strife.” He was released on bail 26 July 2025. The case is now under legal consideration at the Amman Magistrate Court.
Abli is a prominent Instagram personality and activist. Very shortly prior to the arrest, Abli had posted on Instagram critiquing people in Jordan who were engaging in public celebrations while the genocide in Gaza has been ongoing — and it should be noted that a public celebration (the annual Jerash Festival for Culture and Arts) was happening at the time of his posts, which viewers understood the posts to be in response to. He also critiqued state and public inaction in Jordan over Gaza.
On 3 August 2025, Abli posted an Instagram story in which he clarified that he voluntarily presented himself to the authorities, and that the arrest was not in regards to his advocacy regarding Gaza. Further details of the case (including over which content) has not been publicly released. However, public perception believes the arrest is in retaliation to his advocacy and critique of people in Jordan.

"Jordan Teachers Syndicate Law ruled unconstitutional, effectively outlawing the long-embattled teachers union","Event Summary
On 17 July 2025, Jordan’s Constitutional Court issued a ruling declaring the Jordanian Teachers’ Syndicate Law unconstitutional, and considering it void from that day on. The 2011 Jordanian Teachers’ Syndicate Law (No. 14 of 2011 and its amendments) had allowed for the legal formation of a syndicate for teachers, concluding that it was constitutionally permitted. Now, the Constitutional Court’s argument is that the formal requirements enshrined in the Constitution were not fulfilled — that the legislative authority (Parliament) exceeded its limit of powers stipulated in the Constitution by issuing the 2011 law, which was solely in the jurisdiction of the executive authority. With this ruling hereby issued, the final legal step to effectively outlaw the long-embattled teachers union has been carried out.
Far from being a merely technical constitutional matter, the timing of the decision reflects Jordan’s broader political trajectory in 2025: an intensifying crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates. As state actors have long portrayed the Teachers’ Syndicate as a Brotherhood-influenced body, the Constitutional Court’s move can be read as part of a strategy to dismantle one of the mass-mobilizing legacies of the Arab Spring.

"Nepal Blocks Major Social Media Platforms Amid Wider Civic Space Crackdown","Event Summary
On 4 September 2025, the Government of Nepal ordered the Nepal Telecommunications Authority to block 26 unregistered social media platforms, including Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), YouTube, and Instagram. The decision followed repeated deadlines under the 2023 Social Media Operation Directive, which requires platforms to register locally, appoint liaison officers, and designate grievance handlers. While TikTok and Viber complied earlier, most global platforms refused, triggering the suspension order.
Officials justified the ban as a measure to enhance accountability and curb online harms, with the Supreme Court having upheld the state’s authority to regulate digital platforms. However, critics warn that the move undermines freedom of expression, access to information, and economic activity. Civil society actors argue that the ban is part of a broader trend of shrinking civic space. On 30 August and 3 September, CSO leaders, lawyers, and journalists already raised alarm over a draft NGO law that would consolidate and tighten control over civil society operations, which was already flagged in an earlier alert.
Importantly, the government lifted the ban on 9 September after large-scale, youth-led “Gen Z” protests drew significant national attention and public pressure. This reversal highlights both the vulnerability of state measures to civic mobilization and the growing role of youth movements in shaping Nepal’s digital rights landscape, even amid systemic pressures on civic space.
The crackdown is systemic at the national level: it has disproportionately affected youth, digital rights defenders, journalists, and small businesses dependent on online platforms, while also reshaping the enabling environment for all CSOs. Civil society coalitions caution that advocacy must proceed carefully, as smaller organizations and individual activists risk reprisals if directly named. Still, parliamentary debates on the NGO Bill and Social Media Bill, potential strategic litigation by civil society lawyers, and difficult but necessary policy dialogue with the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology represent possible entry points to press for rights-compliant alternatives.
Taken together, the dual crackdown on online platforms and CSOs signals a severe deterioration of Nepal’s enabling environment—threatening fundamental freedoms, weakening accountability, and institutionalizing state control over both digital and civic space.

"Nepal’s Gen Z Protests Escalate: Lethal Crackdown, Arson Attacks, and Government Resignations Undermine Civil Society Environment","Event Summary
On 8–9 September 2025, youth-led “Gen Z” protests over corruption and the government’s move to block 26 social media platforms escalated nationwide. Security forces used water cannons, tear gas, rubber bullets and, in multiple locations, live rounds. Media and hospital reports confirm at least 22 fatalities and more than 500 injuries, many of them students, with numbers continuing to rise as hospitals release updated figures. Despite curfews, unrest intensified on 9 September, with arson and vandalism targeting key government sites including the Parliament building, the Singha Durbar complex, and several political leaders’ residences. Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli resigned, citing a need for a constitutional resolution amid the crisis.
Authorities lifted the social-media ban on 8–9 September, but protests broadened into an anti-corruption movement with calls for accountability and reform. Reporting also points to large-scale prison breaks: some outlets confirm at least 1,500 prisoners escaped, including high-profile political figures, while others cite unverified numbers as high as 13,500. The Nepal Army announced on 10 September that it had assumed command of security operations and enforced a nationwide curfew.
Taken together, these developments represent a severe deterioration of the enabling environment. Lethal crowd control and arbitrary violence against protesters undermine freedoms of assembly and expression; curfews and digital restrictions chill civic participation; arson and attacks on institutions erode public trust and rule-of-law guarantees; mass prison breaks highlight a breakdown in state authority; and the leadership crisis complicates state openness and responsiveness to civil society. The deterioration is systemic and nationwide, with Kathmandu Valley as the epicenter but major cities such as Pokhara, Butwal, and Biratnagar also heavily affected. Nepali civil society organizations have publicly condemned the crackdown, though most prefer not to be quoted directly for security reasons.

"Nepal’s Gen Z Protests: Deadly Crackdown Amid Youth-Led Demands for Justice and Accountability","Event Summary
On 8 September 2025, protests led by Generation Z erupted across Nepal—including Kathmandu, Pokhara, Butwal, and other major city centres—in response to corruption scandals and the government’s decision to ban 26 major social media platforms. The demonstrations quickly escalated into a nationwide uprising. Security forces responded with excessive force, including water cannons, tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition. At least 19 people were killed, with hundreds injured, many of them students. Hospitals were overwhelmed with critically wounded protesters, including victims with gunshot wounds to the head and chest.
Despite curfews, protests intensified on 9 September 2025, following the resignation of the Prime Minister. Reports indicated widespread violence, including attacks on police posts, government offices, and politicians’ residences. Security forces remained deployed at major intersections, but demonstrations continued nationwide. The government lifted the social media ban on September 8 to appease demands, but the unrest has shifted toward a broader political crisis. Civil society organisations condemned the government’s violent crackdown and called for accountability.
While the protests are most visible in Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Butwal, they have spread widely to district capitals. Students and youth are disproportionately affected, but the situation has now escalated into a national political crisis undermining governance structures and public trust in institutions.
These developments represent a serious deterioration of the enabling environment, undermining fundamental freedoms of expression, assembly, and association, eroding trust in state institutions, and exposing youth and civil society activists to heightened risks of violence and repression.

"Government dissolves elected municipality and governorate councils","Event Summary
On 6 July, the Jordanian government announced the dissolution of all Municipal Councils, including the Greater Amman Municipality Council, as well as the Governorate Councils, approximately nine months before the end of their legal term. The government also appointed temporary committees to run municipal affairs in their place.
The official justification for this decision was that the government is preparing a new local administration law, which it argued requires transitional arrangements until the new legislation is enacted and new elections are held.
From a civil society perspective, while reforms to local governance may be necessary, the early dissolution undermines democratic principles by cutting short the mandate of elected bodies.

"Lesotho Times and Sunday Express Editor Arbitrary Arrest","Event Summary
On 29 August 2025, journalist Mohalenyane Phakela, editor of the Lesotho Times and Sunday Express, was arbitrarily arrested and detained by the Directorate on Corruption and Economic Offences (DCEO) after reporting on a corruption scandal involving the Lesotho Correctional Service Commissioner, Mating Nkakala — who had recently been recommended for dismissal by a state Commission of Inquiry as an “incompetent political appointee”. Phakela was lured to DCEO offices under false pretenses, interrogated without charge, pressed to reveal sources, and had his phones seized and searched without a warrant. When he requested legal counsel, he was told he would be detained over the weekend as punishment. He was released only following strong domestic and international pressure.
Phakela has a documented track record of exposing high-level corruption, underscoring clear risks of retaliation: recent investigations include the ballooning Royal Palace project costs (now projected to exceed M500 million), the M109 million fraud at the Ministry of Agriculture, and allegations connected to a M40 million case involving senior figures.
This case represents a serious violation of media freedom and due process in Lesotho, reflecting a broader pattern of pressure against journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists has described the incident as “an attack on the right of every Mosotho to know the truth”. A UN report has also highlighted systemic weaknesses in the DCEO, including political interference and lack of independence.
Taken together, the arrest, incommunicado interrogation, warrantless device search, and threats of punitive detention represent a serious deterioration of the enabling environment—notably freedom of the press and expression, source protection, and due process—with a chilling effect on investigative journalism and public accountability in Lesotho.

"Government and UNDP Launch Strategic Partnership in Trinidad and Tobago, Opening New Opportunities for Civil Society Resources and Engagement","Event Summary
On 7 August 2025, Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar led a high-level meeting with UNDP officials, including Resident Representative Ugo Blanco, and key government representatives to outline a new strategic development partnership. Three major initiatives were announced:

The proposed launch of a US$20 million Social High Impact Fund for Trinidad and Tobago (SHIFTT), aimed at supporting NGOs, CSOs, and SMEs.
The announcement that Trinidad and Tobago will host the Latin America and Caribbean regional launch of the 2025 Human Development Report.
A national youth empowerment platform targeting young people from vulnerable and rural communities.

The SHIFTT fund, developed in collaboration with key ministries, could expand financial access and sustainability for NGOs and CSOs, addressing longstanding under-resourcing of civic actors. The youth platform aims to strengthen leadership, resilience, and economic participation among marginalized youth, creating new avenues for civic inclusion. Meanwhile, by hosting the Human Development Report launch, Trinidad and Tobago positions itself as a regional development leader, with the potential to raise visibility for civil society contributions on the global stage.

While these initiatives represent a potentially transformative shift toward openness and partnership, civil society actors remain cautious given past challenges with sporadic state collaboration. If implemented transparently and inclusively, they could mark a structural improvement in the enabling environment by institutionalizing resource access, civic participation, and state–civil society dialogue.

"Institutional Recognition of Civil Society in Mali’s Peace Charter","Event Summary
On 22 July 2025, Mali&#8217;s transitional authorities submitted the National Charter for Peace and Reconciliation to the President, marking the beginning of a swift and coordinated adoption process. The Council of Ministers endorsed the Charter on 30 July 2025, and Parliament formally approved it on 7 August 2025. This sequence of events reflects a strong political will to institutionalize peace and reconciliation efforts. Crucially, the Charter&#8217;s Titles XIII and XIV delineate the roles and responsibilities of civil society organizations (CSOs), traditional authorities, and citizens, while also formalizing the commitments of public institutions to collaborate with these actors. By embedding civil society into the framework of national peacebuilding, the Charter creates a recognized and structured space for civic engagement, granting CSOs legitimacy and autonomy in decision-making processes. This inclusion signals a shift toward participatory governance, where citizen voices—often amplified by civil society—are integral to shaping reconciliation mechanisms. The implications for the enabling environment are significant: civil society now has a formal mandate to contribute to national dialogue, influence policy, and hold institutions accountable. To fully realize this potential, it will be essential to monitor the implementation of participatory platforms and document the commitments made by state and traditional actors. Testimonies from civil society participants involved in drafting, the Charter will further illuminate the depth of this inclusion and its anticipated impact on Mali&#8217;s civic landscape.

"Argentina — Río Negro declares unconventional exploration in ""Cinco Saltos Sur"" to be of public interest without prior citizen consultation ","Event Summary
On 4 August 2025, the Government of the province of Río Negro published Decree No. 629/25 declaring Pan American Energy&#8217;s (PAE) private initiative  to explore unconventional hydrocarbons in the &#8220;Cinco Saltos Sur&#8221; block, which includes part of Lake Pellegrini,  to be of public interest. The measure authorizes the National and International Public Tender No. 01/25 and grants PAE the right of preference in case of matching the best offer. According to the official communication, the plan foresees an initial investment of US$ 8.5 million in the first three years, with the drilling of a vertical well of 3,000 m and a horizontal branch of 2,000 m, and in a successful scenario the province projects up to 147 horizontal wells.
Social organizations and local communities denounce the absence of citizen participation and prior consultation, opacity in impact studies and a logic of fait accompli that marginalizes indigenous and peasant communities, in contravention of standards of consultation/free, prior and informed consent (ILO Convention 169 / FPIC) and the Escazú Agreement. In November 2024, the provincial government had already been questioned for unilaterally imposing a &#8220;consultation&#8221; protocol without indigenous participation. These participation deficits are part of a regional pattern of expansion of unconventional with weak participatory instances, already observed in Vaca Muerta, including the Campo Maripe case  raised to the United Nations by local and international organizations due  to the absence of FPIC and socio-environmental risks.
Although the provincial government indicates environmental and water requirements (risk studies, environmental sensitivity and contingency plans), territorial actors warn  of cumulative impacts on water, health, biodiversity and rural/indigenous ways of life, in a context of criminalization and harassment reported against Mapuche communities in Patagonia. Local media report that the block covers ~252 km² and includes part of Lake Pellegrini, with scarce 2D seismic information and a history of hydrocarbon activity since 1979, elements that increase the socio-environmental sensitivity of the Project. On July 22, 2025, in  a hearing before the IACHR, Mapuche representatives from Mendoza, Neuquén, and Río Negro denounced a systematic pattern of violations linked to the extractive advance, requesting measures to prevent evictions, restore protections, and guarantee FPIC.
Due to the lack of substantive participation and consultation and the weakening of institutional dialogue mechanisms, this case reflects a deterioration under Principle 4 (Open and Responsive State) of the enabling environment, reducing the capacity of communities and CSOs to influence and exercise social oversight in decisions of high territorial and environmental impact.

"Mendoza police attempt to enter Ni Una Menos assembly without a warrant","Event Summary
On 2 September 2025, Mendoza Police officers tried to enter a peaceful assembly of the Ni Una Menos movement at the headquarters of the Ecumenical Association of Cuyo without a warrant. The participants denounced the event as an act of intimidation that violates freedom of assembly, association and political participation. According to the collective, the officers argued that they &#8220;corroborated disturbances,&#8221; which was perceived as a form of institutional harassment.
The episode was widely reported in local media such as COMECUCO (04.09.2025), El Editor Mendoza (04.09.2025), Diario Mendoza (03.09.2025) and Mendoza Today (04.09.2025). The Ni Una Menos collective also formally denounced the harassment before the Legislature of Mendoza and filed a Preventive Habeas Corpus.
Feminist organizations stressed that the event occurred on the same day that another femicide was recorded in the province, evidencing the paradox of a police force that intimidates those who fight against gender violence instead of protecting them.

"Zambian CSOs Warn Against Unconstitutional Reintroduction of Constitutional Amendment Bill No. 7 of 2025","Event Summary
On 11 September 2025, civil society organisations (CSOs) in Zambia issued a joint statement warning against the possible reintroduction of the Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) Bill No. 7 of 2025. This concern arises despite the Bill having been deferred by President Hakainde Hichilema following a meeting with CSOs on 24 June 2025, during which he committed to broad consultations.  Subsequently, on 27 June 2025, the Constitutional Court declared the Bill unconstitutional due to insufficient public consultation. Despite this, on 5 September 2025, the Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms. Nelly Mutti, said that she had noted a general plea from Chiefs in Muchinga Province for government to go ahead with the constitutional review process. This statement has reignited fears among CSOs that the Bill may be reintroduced in Parliament, potentially in defiance of the Court’s ruling. In response, CSOs have publicly expressed concern that such a move would undermine democratic principles and the rule of law. The situation poses serious implications for the enabling environment for civil society in Zambia, as it reflects a potential disregard for judicial authority and inclusive governance, threatening the space for meaningful civic engagement and participation in Zambia’s democratic processes.
Suggested actions include sustained public mobilization, legal preparedness to challenge any unconstitutional reintroduction, direct advocacy with Parliament and the Executive, and targeted international engagement to highlight the risks of undermining judicial authority.

"Somali National Women Organization Faces Existential Risk After Forced Displacement","Event Summary
The Somali National Women Organization (SNWO) faces severe operational challenges following its forced eviction from Guriga Hooyooyinka (House of Somali Women) in Mogadishu on 9 February 2025, which had long served as its central hub for women’s civic engagement, leadership, and programming. Without access to this space, SNWO is struggling to maintain its activities, leadership continuity, and institutional stability. The disruption has had immediate and ongoing consequences for women-led civic initiatives across Somalia.
This crisis began on 6 January 2025, when the Prime Minister ordered SNWO to vacate the premises to make way for the Ministry of Family Affairs. On 9 February 2025, police forcibly seized the compound, with reports of arrests, intimidation, and violence against women leaders. SNWO Chairperson Mama Batulo reported being threatened and coerced into signing documents under duress. In response, SNWO issued a 24-hour ultimatum to the Ministry of Women and Human Rights Development, accusing Minister Bashir Goobe of abusing government authority to seize the property. The incident signals a persistent threat to women’s civic participation and institutional resilience, demonstrating a lack of respect for civic actors and their spaces. It also violates access to sustainable resources, as SNWO has lost not only its physical office but also the networks and legitimacy tied to that location. The manner of eviction, marked by intimidation and disregard for dignity, has further damaged SNWO’s public image and weakened trust in state-civil society relations. Without intervention or mediation, the consequences may extend further, undermining women’s leadership and advocacy efforts nationwide and weakening the enabling environment for civil society in Somalia.

"Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority Suspends JamiiForums Platform License and Blocks its Access for 90 days","Event Summary
On 6 September 2025, the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) suspended JamiiForums’ Online Content License for 90 days and ordered immediate blocking of access to the platform, citing violations of the Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations (Amended in 2022 and 2025). The suspension followed JamiiForums’ publication of politically sensitive content, including statements by politician Humphrey Polepole alleging improper acquisition of the Ngaka coal mine by businessman Rostam Aziz, and coverage of meetings between President Samia Suluhu Hassan and Zimbabwean businessman Wicknell Chivayo. TCRA claimed the platform failed to verify images, seek comment from relevant authorities, and moderate user content deemed offensive to the President and contrary to national values. In response, JamiiForums blocked access to its platform in Tanzania, while publicly disagreeing with the regulator’s decision, arguing it undermines freedom of expression and access to information.
To note is that the suspension came at a critical moment in the electoral cycle where critical voices need an independent platform and will continue until 6 December 2025, which is roughly one month after the General Election scheduled for 29 October 2025. The incident has had a chilling effect on digital civic space, particularly for platforms that facilitate public discourse and government accountability. The suspension disrupts JamiiForums’ operations and silences a key outlet for civil society engagement, affecting freedom of expression and access to a secure digital environment. It also raises concerns about the selective enforcement of content regulations and the broader implications for media independence and civic participation in Tanzania. Without transparent redress mechanisms, this action risks setting a precedent for further restrictions on online civic platforms.
This incident is part of an ongoing pattern in which media outlets have faced shutdowns, especially newspapers such as Raia Mwema and Uhuru, as well as the suspension of Mwananchi’s online publishing license. Similarly, television and radio stations like Clouds TV and Clouds FM have previously been suspended for allegedly violating the Code on Political Party Elections Broadcasting.

"Zimbabwe Gazettes New Registration Fees for Private Voluntary Organisations","Event Summary
On 29 August 2025, the Government of Zimbabwe gazetted new registration fees for Private Voluntary Organisations (PVOs) under Statutory Instrument 82 of 2025, implementing provisions of the recently enacted and widely criticised PVO Amendment Act. The new regulations require international PVOs to pay US$250 and local organisations US$150, with payments also accepted in local currency at the prevailing bank rate. While the government claims the fees are intended to enhance transparency and accountability, the timing and nature of the fee structure have raised concerns about the financial burden on grassroots organisations, many of which already struggle to sustain operations.
The introduction of new registration fees for PVOs is not an isolated event but part of a broader and ongoing pattern of government efforts to regulate civil society more strictly. It reflects the state’s persistent push to centralise oversight and apply a uniform regulatory framework, often without considering the diverse capacities and contexts in which different CSOs operate. While the distinction between international and local organisations in the fee structure is commendable, the regulations still overlook the significant variations within the local sector itself, ranging from large, nationally recognised NGOs with substantial budgets to small, community-based organisations operating in rural areas with minimal resources. Critics argue that this disproportionately affects smaller, community-based groups and may lead to their reduced civic engagement, especially in rural and marginalised areas, undermining the ability of grassroots actors to contribute meaningfully to national development.

"Journalist’s Arrest Signals Growing Threat to Press Freedom in Zambia","Event Summary
On 25 August 2025, journalist Thandizo Banda from The Mast newspaper was arrested and detained for three hours at Chowa Police Station in Zambia after photographing a vehicle transporting Electoral Commission Chairperson Mwangala Zaloumis, who was visiting her daughter held on murder charges. Banda was released only after paying an admission of guilt fine. The following day, the Zambia Police Service issued a statement describing the incident as a “brief detention” and alleging that Banda attempted to force entry into an office—an account that contradicts eyewitness reports and civil society sources, which affirm that Banda was simply performing his professional duties in a public space. The incident has sparked concern among media and civil society actors, who have publicly criticized the arrest and the police’s narrative as part of a broader pattern of harassment and intimidation against journalists. The criminalization of routine news-gathering, especially when it involves politically sensitive figures, signals a deteriorating environment for press freedom in Zambia. This event undermines key principles of the enabling environment for civil society—freedom of expression. There is a growing risk of normalization of arrests and fines as tools to intimidate journalists. The chilling effect of such actions discourages investigative journalism and weakens public accountability, particularly in the lead-up to national elections. Without safeguards to protect journalists from arbitrary enforcement, the space for independent media and civic engagement risks further erosion.

"Attacks on Tunisian General Labour Union","Event Summary
The Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT), continues to face escalating systematic pressure and politically motivated attacks that threaten its role in civil society. These actions, which appear politically motivated and lack meaningful opposition from state institutions, signal a deliberate effort to weaken the union’s influence in civic and political life. If left unchecked, this erosion of credibility and space for trade union activism could have lasting consequences for democratic engagement and civil liberties in Tunisia. The most recent deterioration began on 7 August 2025, when regime supporters staged a protest outside the UGTT headquarters in Tunis, accusing it of corruption and demanding its dissolution following a national transport strike organized by the union. The UGTT responded by accusing the demonstrators of being mobilized by the regime to weaken its influence. A week later, another demonstration attempted to storm the union’s headquarters, with no significant intervention from security forces.
The Tunisian Human Rights League condemned the act as a “criminal attack,” and other civil and political actors denounced it as politically driven. The International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) also condemned and criticized the attacks, calling them a serious violation of civil and trade union freedoms and urging the government to resume genuine social dialogue. Despite these threats, on 21 August 2025, thousands of trade unionists protested in Tunis to defend civil liberties and union rights, denouncing repression, rising prices, and the use of militias to undermine unions, and release of political prisoners while police blocked public participation. This mobilization reaffirmed the union’s resilience and its central role in Tunisia’s civic landscape. However, the ongoing targeting of the UGTT signals a deteriorating enabling environment for civil society, particularly affecting principles such as state openness to civil society, freedom of association and peaceful assembly. The lack of protection from state institutions and politically motivated hostility risk undermining Tunisia’s democratic foundations and the legitimacy of civic actors.

"Hong Kong police summon family members of overseas ""Hong Kong Parliament"" activists for questioning","Event Summary
Following the issuance of arrest warrants and bounties on 25 July 2025 for 19 overseas activists affiliated with the “Hong Kong Parliament,” national security police in Hong Kong began summoning family members of those targeted for questioning. On 13 August 2025, Alan Keung’s father was taken in to assist investigations, and on 19 August 2025, Chin Po-fun’s sister was summoned to Tuen Mun police station. Both activists, currently overseas, are among the 15 individuals with HK$200,000 bounties for their involvement in the shadow legislature’s May 2025 elections. In response, Keung’s father publicly severed ties with him through a newspaper statement, distancing the family from his political activities. Chin Po-fun, a UK-based retiree and former Correctional Services Department employee, left Hong Kong in 2022 after joining the opposition party People Power. These summonses mark an escalation in pressure tactics, extending national security enforcement beyond activists themselves to their family networks. This approach imposes psychological strain and potential legal risk on relatives, signaling a broader strategy to deter overseas dissent. The targeting of family members undermines the enabling environment for civil society by shrinking the space for political expression and creating fear among diaspora communities and their connections in Hong Kong.

"Former pro-democracy district councillor Chan Kim-kam faces commercial blacklisting as stationery shop is denied lease renewal","Event Summary
On 14 August 2025, former Tsuen Wan District Councillor Chan Kim-kam, a pro-democracy actor was denied lease renewal for her stationery shop “Heung Together” at West Kowloon Centre, forcing its closure by 30 September after four years of operation. Mall management also rejected her request to relocate within the premises, citing unspecified “upper level” decisions after confirming her identity. Chan believes the decision was politically motivated, linked to her sale of commemorative candles bearing the message “Memory Never Dies, Conscience Never Ends” during the June 4th anniversary. Since June, her shop faced increased inspections and surveillance, with mall staff reportedly carrying police-issued documents. Chan, previously arrested under Article 23 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance in May 2024 and later released on bail, criticized the mall’s actions as a form of censorship targeting politically sensitive individuals. She questioned the existence of economic freedom when small businesses are excluded for political reasons. Chan now plans to relocate to Sham Shui Po, a diverse and community-oriented district. This incident highlights growing constraints on civil society in Hong Kong, particularly regarding freedom of expression and association, and signals a shrinking enabling environment for politically active individuals and organizations.
Chan Kim-kam has faced systematic exclusion from various sectors since her arrest under the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance. In May 2025, she was removed from both a theatre production and part-time teaching position on the same day, with authorities citing her political background. The Leisure and Cultural Services Department threatened to revoke venue bookings unless she was removed from theatrical performances, while an academic institution terminated her position after receiving an anonymous complaint. Her stationery shop &#8220;Heung Together&#8221; represented one of her remaining sources of income and connection to public life.
The use of commercial and regulatory pressure to silence dissent undermines both economic freedom and civic space. It sends a chilling message to other civil society actors and small business owners that political expression may result in livelihood loss.

"Himayati: A New Opportunity for CSOs to Strengthen Gender-Based Violence Response in Algeria","Event Summary
On 2 September 2025, the Ministry of National Solidarity, Family and Women&#8217;s Affairs in Algeria launched the digital platform Himayati, designed to support women affected by violence by enabling secure reporting, offering advice, and connecting victims with relevant institutions such as police, justice, and health services. This initiative is part of the national strategy to protect women and promote their rights, and it complements existing support mechanisms by expanding access through digital tools. The platform is viewed as a meaningful step toward improving institutional responsiveness and coverage for survivors of gender-based violence. By institutionalizing digital access to support services, the government demonstrates a commitment to strengthening coordination and transparency in addressing violence against women. If effectively implemented and maintained, this platform could enhance trust between citizens and institutions, empower victims, and reinforce civil society’s role in advocating for gender justice.
Civil society organisations are encouraged to engage with the platform early, to advocate for its accessibility and responsiveness and to monitor its integration into institutional workflows.
Le 2 septembre 2025, le Ministère de la Solidarité nationale, de la Famille et de la Condition féminine a lancé la plateforme numérique « Himayati ».
Cette plateforme vise à faciliter le signalement des violences faites aux femmes, à offrir un espace de conseil et de soutien, ainsi qu’à mettre en relation les victimes avec les institutions compétentes (sécurité, justice, santé). Elle s’inscrit dans la stratégie nationale de protection de la femme et de promotion de ses droits, en complétant les dispositifs existants de prise en charge et en élargissant l’accès via un outil digital sécurisé. Cet événement représente un pas positif vers une meilleure couverture et une réponse coordonnée aux besoins des femmes victimes de violence.
Les organisations de la société civile sont encouragées à utiliser la plateforme, à plaider en faveur de son accessibilité et de sa réactivité, et à surveiller son intégration dans les processus institutionnels.

"Argentina — Government Decides Not to Run for UN Human Rights Council  ","Event Summary
On 1 September 2025, the Argentine government announced that it will not present its candidacy for membership of the United Nations Human Rights Council, breaking with a tradition of more than four decades of active participation in this multilateral body.
Various human rights organizations and unions described the decision as a historic setback and a weakening of the State&#8217;s policy on Memory, Truth and Justice. While Argentina will continue to be bound by the international human rights treaties it has ratified, its absence from the Council implies a loss of influence in key debates and votes and adds to other signs of multilateral retraction, such as the decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization.
The measure is framed in a context of official discourses critical of the international human rights system and multilateralism in general. In his speech to the UN General Assembly in September 2024, President Javier Milei accused the UN of imposing an &#8220;ideological agenda&#8221; on its members and promoting systematic violations of freedom during the 2020 global quarantines, going so far as to suggest that these should be considered crimes against humanity. He also questioned the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) and the inclusion of countries such as Cuba and Venezuela in the Human Rights Council, framing these bodies within what he called an &#8220;ideological agenda.&#8221;
These statements reinforce a climate of intolerance and delegitimization of international human rights organizations, with direct implications for Argentine civil society. Social organizations have requested hearings with the UN Human Rights Council and the IACHR regarding the attacks received in terms of labor rights, the operation of community kitchens and the violation of the rights of indigenous peoples (Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization – ILO). However, the Argentine government&#8217;s decision not to appear at the Council reduces the spaces for advocacy and international cooperation for civil society organizations (CSOs). Added to this is the obstruction or reduction of technical and financial assistance projects of agencies of the United Nations system since the arrival to power of the administration of La Libertad Avanza in December 2023.
This diplomatic setback constitutes a deterioration of the environment. While this is a foreign policy decision, the combination of withdrawal from multilateral spaces, anti-UN hate speech, and reduced CSO access to international technical and financial cooperation has worrying spillover effects on Principle 5 of the EU SEE methodology: public culture and discourse on civil society. In particular, it weakens international cooperation and erodes the ability of Argentine CSOs to influence multilateral forums and defend an enabling environment for civil society.

"Colombia's National Government Proposes Cutting Funding to the Ombudsman's Office","Event Summary
In its 2026 budget proposal, the national government of Colombia seeks implement a 3% reduction in funding for the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, the institution responsible for defending human rights across the country. This decision comes at a time when Colombia is facing an intensification of armed conflict, particularly in vulnerable territories where the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office plays a critical role in monitoring abuses, protecting civilians, and advocating for justice. While the government cites a broader budget crisis as justification for the cuts, international organizations such as Human Rights Watch have warned against defunding key institutions that help prevent violence and uphold human rights. The proposed reduction threatens to weaken the operational capacity of the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, undermining its ability to respond to ongoing threats and support communities affected by conflict. This move signals a looming deterioration in the enabling environment for civil society, as it risks silencing one of the few institutional voices capable of denouncing abuses and defending social leaders, many of whom continue to be targeted and killed. The international community should closely monitor this development and advocate for the protection of human rights infrastructure in Colombia.
&nbsp;
El gobierno nacional de Colombia ha presentado su propuesta de presupuesto para el año 2026. Dentro de una alerta destacada, se encontró que busca reducir el presupuesto de la Defensoría del Pueblo, entidad encargada de la defensa de los derechos humanos en el país, en un 3%, lo cual tendría un fuerte impacto en la capacidad de operación de la entidad, en el marco de un momento en el cual el conflicto armado se ha recrudecido en el país y amenaza la vida y los derechos de las personas, especialmente en los territorios más vulnerables.
Colombia viene enfrentando una crisis presupuestal que el gobierno se encuentra tratando de abordar. Sin embargo, organizaciones internacionales como Human Rights Watch han realizado un llamado a no desfinanciar actores claves que como la Defensoría contribuyen a la prevención de la violencia.
Esta es una alerta que amerita seguimiento y acompañamiento de la comunidad internacional, para prevenir este recorte y sus posibles impactos sobre los derechos humanos. El impacto sobre el entorno habilitante puede ser importante, ya que ante el continuo asesinato de líderes sociales y violencia generalizada en algunos territorios del país, la Defensoría juega un rol clave en su prevención y denuncia.

"Expected EU Tax Delisting provides opportunities for funding access","Event Summary
On 24 August 2025, the Trinidad and Tobago Guardian reported that the country is likely to be removed from the European Union&#8217;s tax blacklist (Annex I) by February 2026. The report cites recent legal reforms, including enhanced tax transparency measures, treaty ratifications, and a &#8220;largely compliant&#8221; rating from the OECD Global Forum on transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes. The Finance Minister emphasized that this progress will improve T&amp;T’s international financial reputation and reduce barriers to trade and investment.
While the delisting is primarily framed as a financial and diplomatic milestone, it carries direct and indirect consequences for civil society. EU blacklisting has historically limited access to international funding and increased banking scrutiny on CSOs. Removal from the list could ease restrictions on foreign funding, encourage philanthropic investment, and reduce administrative burdens for NGOs. These changes may strengthen the financial sustainability and legitimacy of civil society, particularly those engaged in human rights, development, and climate action work.

"Centralisation and cuts at Radio Nacional reduce pluralism of provincial voices and access to information","Event Summary
From 2024 and with greater intensity in 2025, unions and regional media denounce a reduction in the federal reach of Radio Nacional: salary freezes, budget and endowment cuts, and replacement of local content with centralized signals from Buenos Aires.
On 31 July 2025, Decree 525/2025 formalized the transformation of Radio y Televisión Argentina into a Sociedad Anónima Unipersonal (RTA S.A.U.) under intervention, which —according to workers— enables greater recentralization and eventual privatization. FATPREN and CiSPren warn of &#8220;information blackouts&#8221; in areas where public radio is the only reliable source and cite cases such as in Chubut, where cuts affected rural messaging.
On Radio Nacional Esquel, the withdrawal of local FM content and the suppression of provincial addresses are reported. The precedent of the closure and reconversion of Télam in 2024 under Decree 548/2024 reinforces the concern about a structural erosion of the public communication ecosystem in Argentina.
The reduction of regional content and the silencing of diverse voices weaken the democratic function of public media, especially in a country characterized by its territorial diversity. Civil society organizations, especially those working in subnational or rural contexts, lose space to disseminate their problems, campaigns, or initiatives. This diminishes their ability to influence the public agenda and deteriorates pluralism, an essential value in any democracy. It also affects equitable access to information and media representation in the communities furthest from the federal capital.

"Police Assault on Prime TV Journalist Raises Fears of Shrinking Media Space Ahead of Zambia’s 2026 Elections","Event Summary
On 18 September 2025 in Chipata, Zambia, Prime TV reporter Christopher Bazilio Banda was assaulted by police officers while documenting a joint operation between the Zambia Police and the Road Transport and Safety Agency (RTSA). Banda was attacked and had his mobile phone confiscated as he filmed the impounding of unregistered motorbikes. The motive for the assault remains unclear. Media civil society organizations, including the Eastern Press Club, swiftly condemned the attack, describing it as a serious violation of press freedom and a threat to the media’s watchdog role. The Eastern Province Police Commissioner, Mr. Robertson Mweemba, expressed regret over the officer’s conduct, and both the officer and senior police officials have since apologized to Mr. Banda and the media community.
This incident follows the unlawful detention of another journalist, Thandizo Banda, less than a month prior, highlighting a troubling pattern of intimidation against the media by law enforcement. These repeated assaults on journalists undermine constitutional guarantees of press freedom and signal a deteriorating environment for civil society. The proximity of such incidents, especially ahead of the 2026 elections, raises concerns about the safety of independent media and the shrinking space for civic engagement.

"Report by the Ombudsman's Office on the riots and declaration of a state of emergency in Bocas del Toro.","
Event Summary



On September 9, 2025, the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office of the Republic of Panama and the National Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture (MNTP) published the report corresponding to the visits carried out following the riots and declaration of a state of emergency in the province of Bocas del Toro. According to the report, based on interviews with victims, the following was found: &#8220;Police and security personnel employed excessive and indiscriminate force, using tear gas, pepper spray, and other non-lethal weapons such as rubber bullets, causing physical injuries and using them at close range from the victims, which is contrary to standards regarding the use of non-lethal weapons.&#8221; Evidence was also documented of excessive use of force, acts of humiliation, deprivation of food and water for detainees, and failure to provide medical care. The detentions were carried out for prolonged periods without a warrant from the competent authority, and transfers were made to other provinces without notification to family members and without the right to defense. These acts constitute violations of international human rights standards.The Ombudsman&#8217;s Office confirmed the deaths of a minor and another adult during the riots. Both cases are under investigation by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. The report concludes that the United Nations Human Rights Guidelines on the Use of Non-Lethal Weapons in Law Enforcement were not respected,  as well as the the Organic Law of the National Police. Furthermore, the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules) were violated. Based on the report, civil society and other stakeholders can put pressure on government and demand accountability from the National Police for the measures taken to investigate and punish the human right violations committed.

"Myanmar Intensifies Digital Repression Infrastructure","Event Summary
A sharp intensification of Myanmar’s digital crackdown unfolded in September 2025, as the military regime deployed new surveillance tools and legal measures to further restrict civic space and monitor online activity. On 8 September, junta police and military forces in Nyaung Oo Township, Bagan used the AI-powered Person Scrutinization and Monitoring System (PSMS) to cross-check hotel guest lists leading to the arrest of several Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) members, including nurses and teachers who were visiting for pilgrimage. The following day, 9 September, Justice For Myanmar published an investigative report revealing that the Chinese company Geedge Networks has supplied the junta with a commercial version of China’s “Great Firewall.” According to this report, this technology enables the regime to conduct real-time surveillance and geolocation of Myanmar’s 33.4 million internet users, with operational support from 13 domestic telecommunications providers.
These developments build on the 30 July 2025 formal notification No. (113/2025) by junta leader Min Aung Hlaing bringing into force the Cybersecurity Law enacted on 1 January 2025. The law mandates that digital platforms with over 100,000 users retain detailed user data for up to three years and provide unrestricted access to the regime upon request. It also authorizes arbitrary shutdowns of online services and seizure of digital infrastructure, effectively legalizing censorship and asset confiscation.  This legislation underpins a broader surveillance system developed since the 2021 coup, incorporating AI-powered PSMS, facial recognition CCTV networks, and national databases modeled after technologies from China, Russia, and India. These tools are actively used to target individuals based on social media activity, VPN usage, and online dissent. The law’s implementation marks a severe deterioration in Myanmar’s civic space, crushing digital freedoms, violating privacy, and silencing dissent. It entrenches authoritarian control over both virtual and physical spaces, leaving civil society actors, journalists, and ordinary citizens vulnerable to persecution and eliminating safe avenues for expression and mobilization. The law comes came to support technologies that have already resulted in mass arrests—1,657 people detained via PSMS in just three months (March-May 2025)—and world-record 85 internet shutdowns in 2024.
For journalists and media, the new surveillance tools and legal measures create immediate legal risks for using encrypted communication and VPNs, essential tools for their safety and work. This forces media further underground and accelerates a media blackout, depriving the public of independent information. For civil society and activists, the requirement for platforms to hand over data and use of PSMS dismantle digital anonymity. The resultant fear of arrest based on online activity is causing widespread self-censorship on social media and messaging apps, stifling free expression and organizing.

"Swedish aid cut hurts Myanmar human rights defenders and independent media","Event Summary
On 11 September 2025, the Swedish government announced its decision to phase out all development assistance to Myanmar by June 30, 2026. This strategic reallocation aims to prioritize increased support for Ukraine, including a planned military aid boost to USD 4.2 billion annually for 2026-2027 and a minimum of USD 1 billion in annual civilian support from 2026-2028. The deteriorating conditions for development cooperation following the 2021 failed coup in Myanmar also influenced the decision. While humanitarian aid will continue, development funding through Sweden’s aid agency, SIDA, will be capped at USD 18 million in 2025 and USD 15 million in 2026 before full termination. This move eliminates a critical lifeline for Myanmar&#8217;s pro-democracy movement, directly cutting USD 2.65 million in annual support for independent media and human rights groups, threatening their survival and accelerating a collapse of independent reporting and rights monitoring.
The withdrawal of Swedish development aid removes a critical source of international solidarity and financial lifeline for civil society actors at a critical moment where CSOs are operating under extreme repression and in dire need of support. Survival of independent journalism and rights monitoring is threatened at a time when civic space is rapidly closing.
Civil society groups have expressed concern that the decision undermines international solidarity and risks weakening efforts to document rights abuses under military rule. The Human Rights Myanmar noted that this decision sends a deeply demoralizing signal to civil society, journalists, and human rights defenders, that principled, long-term support for their struggle is unreliable and subject to shifting donor priorities, thereby eroding solidarity in ways that may prove even more damaging than the loss of funding itself.

"Pattern of deterioration of freedoms in Venezuela continues","Event Summary
Although by the end of July 2025 up to 57 people detained for political reasons were released, in the following weeks a new wave of arrests was recorded, targeting both human rights defenders and activists, as well as trade union leaders from various sectors. At the same time, the pattern of repression against peaceful protests has continued. On 8 August 2025, Martha Lía Grajales , a defender from the collective Surgentes , was arrested during a peaceful protest in front of the United Nations headquarters in Caracas. Days later, news emerged from her release , but under precautionary measures that restrict her freedom, while judicial proceedings against her remain ongoing. Similarly, several arrests of union and trade leaders have been documented, particularly from the education sector and the judiciary .
One emblematic case is that of the President of the Barinas State Nursing Association , who has been detained for over 20 days without his lawyers or family being informed of the charges against him. Other cases include the arrests of José Texeira , a member of a teachers&#8217; union in Sucre State; Roberto Campero , a union leader from the same sector in Aragua State; and Rusbelia Astudillo , to defend the rights of retired judicial workers.
On 15 August 2025, President Nicolás Maduro, during a public event with teachers , called for a reform to establish new trade union structures—an appeal that has been interpreted as an attack on independent unionism and trade union freedoms.

"Rising tensions ahead of demonstrations in Madagascar","
Event SummaryA major protest is planned for 25 September 2025 in downtown Antananarivo, with mobilisation rapidly growing. Authorisation for the protest has been rejected by the municipality. The demonstration was triggered by the arrest and judicial supervision of two municipal councilors who tried to organise peaceful protests against power and water cuts. Their detention sparked public outrage and solidarity from civil society and citizen groups. The Gen Z Mada collective, with over 560 members, has pledged to join, and the #DemokrasiaMainty campaign is widely circulating online, fuelling participation. Tensions are rising both on social media and on the ground, raising the risk of confrontation during the protest.



&nbsp;Government reaction has been increasingly hostile, with senior officials publicly criticising the campaign and dismissing civil society’s role, framing it as partisan. Information indicates that downtown Antananarivo is currently surrounded by the military, and while the situation on the ground remains calm, tensions are running high on social media, with calls for mass participation spreading rapidly.



Tensions croissantes à l&#8217;approche des manifestations à Madagascar



Une grande manifestation est&nbsp;prévue&nbsp;le 25 septembre 2025 dans le centre-ville d&#8217;Antananarivo, et la mobilisation s&#8217;intensifie rapidement. Cette manifestation a été déclenchée par l&#8217;arrestation et la mise sous contrôle judiciaire de deux conseillers municipaux qui tentaient d&#8217;organiser des manifestations pacifiques contre les coupures d&#8217;électricité et d&#8217;eau. Leur détention a suscité l&#8217;indignation du public et la solidarité de la société civile et de groupes de citoyens. Le collectif Gen Z Mada, qui compte plus de 560 membres, s&#8217;est engagé à y participer, et la campagne #DemokrasiaMainty circule largement en ligne, alimentant la participation. Les tensions montent tant sur les réseaux sociaux que sur le terrain, augmentant le risque d&#8217;affrontements pendant la manifestation.La réaction du gouvernement est de plus en plus hostile, les hauts fonctionnaires critiquant publiquement la campagne et rejetant le rôle de la société civile, qu&#8217;ils qualifient de partisane. Selon certaines informations, le centre-ville d&#8217;Antananarivo serait actuellement encerclé par l&#8217;armée. Si la situation sur le terrain reste calme, les tensions sont vives sur les réseaux sociaux, où les appels à une participation massive se multiplient rapidement.

"Exclusion of publishing house from Huancayo International Book Fair","Event Summary
On 19 August 2025, publisher Ediciones Achawata was excluded from the 9th Huancayo International Book Fair (FILH) despite having completed registration, paid fees, and been assigned a booth. When the team arrived to set up, they were ordered to vacate the space and later informed via WhatsApp that the booth had been reassigned due to “miscoordination” with the Institute of Youth and Culture. The director of the Institute of Youth and Culture, stated that the decision was made by the Junín Decentralized Directorate of Culture but stressed that the fair should be inclusive. 
The publishing house accused the Ministry of Culture and the Municipality of Huancayo of harassment and persecution. The exclusion drew strong criticism from writers, publishers, and the wider cultural community. For instance, some writer and historian cancelled scheduled presentation, calling the measure discriminatory and harmful to both the publishing house and the community. 
This is the third time Ediciones Achawata has reported censorship. In 2023, it was excluded from the La Independiente Book Fair after publishing a book critical of the Ministry of Culture’s funding practices. In July 2025 its presentation of Revolución en los Andes at the Lima International Book Fair was cancelled by the Peruvian Book Chamber for alleged advocacy of terrorism.   
This trend reflects shrinking space for cultural actors to participate freely in public events. The exclusion of a legitimate publisher undermines freedom of expression and access to cultural participation, potentially discouraging independent publishers and writers from engaging in similar platforms due to fear of arbitrary exclusion or retaliation.

"Court upholds convictions for murders of Indigenous Leaders in Ucayali","Event Summary
On 25 August 2025, the First Criminal Appeals Chamber of the Superior Court of Justice of Ucayali upheld the convictions of businessmen Hugo Soria and José Estrada Huayta, along with brothers Segundo and Josimar Atachi Felix. They were convicted in 2024 by a court in Ucayali for the 2014 murders of four Ashéninka leaders — Edwin Chota Valera, Jorge Ríos Pérez, Leoncio Quintisima Meléndez, and Francisco Pinedo Ramírez — who had opposed illegal logging in their ancestral territory and for denouncing illegal logging activities to various authorities since 2008. The court had sentenced them to 28 years in prison and ordered civil reparations amounting to 50,000 soles. However, the ruling was appealed: the convicted individuals sought its annulment, while the Prosecutor’s Office requested an increased sentence. Ultimately, the First Criminal Appeals Chamber upheld the sentences and also increased civil reparations awarded to the victims’ families from 200,000 to 400,000 soles (approx. US$113,000). 
This ruling represents a major step forward in strengthening the enabling environment for human and environmental rights defenders in Peru. It sends a clear message that justice can prevail even against powerful economic interests, acknowledges the grave risks faced by Indigenous defenders, and reinforces the legitimacy of their demands before the State. Asociación Interétnica de Desarrollo de la Selva Peruana &#8211; AIDESEP Vice President welcomed the decision, noting that it “paves the way for other cases involving Indigenous people who have been murdered defending their territories,” highlighting that over 35 defenders have lost their lives.

"Renewed push for adoption of the Law for the Protection of Journalists and Human Rights Defenders","Event Summary
At the end of September 2025, the 180th Period of Sessions of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACtHR) was held in Asunción, an opportunity to supervise Paraguay&#8217;s compliance with judgments against the State and to analyze international cases. Among the cases in Paraguay is that of Santiago Leguizamón, a journalist murdered in 1991, which led to a judgement against the State in 2022, pointing out the lack of guarantees for the exercise of journalism and the defense of Human Rights and establishing the approval of a law for the protection of journalists and human rights defenders as one of the necessary reparation measures. In 2023, the respective bill was presented in Congress and is still under study, without final approval.
In response to the sessions of the Court, the Paraguayan Journalists&#8217; Union (SPP) urged the approval of the protection law, while new attacks on journalists have been recorded in recent days. In late August, M. Portillo, in the Department of Guairá, received death threats via WhatsApp; in September, F. Costa, press chief of a municipality in the metropolitan area, and C. Benítez, a television and radio journalist, were attacked with bullets in their vehicle and their home, respectively; threats against journalist A. Gómez, in Pedro Juan Caballero, remain under investigation.
On 23 September 2025, IACtHR judges held a protocol meeting with congressional authorities during which the Law on the Protection of Journalists and Human Rights Defenders was addressed, highlighting its importance, in times of regression of democracy, given the work &#8220;carried out by the press to make transparent and provide information to citizens to control the abusive exercise of power, corruption.&#8221; The Senate later released a statement repudiating the attacks suffered by journalists. It was announced by the Senate&#8217;s Human Rights Commission that the bill already has a favorable opinion and would be discussed in the next 15 days. The adoption of this instrument was also subject of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and recommended in 2016 during the second cycle as well as in 2021 during the third cycle.
The Law on the Protection of Journalists and Human Rights Defenders is expected to strengthen prevention, protection and remedial actions for journalists and human rights defenders, as indicated by the journalists&#8217; union. The draft law has been prepared with the participation of civil society organizations and has already been the subject of public hearings, as well as wide socialization in different parts of the country.

"Election irregularities and media polarization hamper citizen participation","Event Summary
On 17 August 2025, national elections were held in Bolivia. Rodrigo Paz of the Christian Democratic Party and Jorge Tuto Quiroga of Libre obtained first and second place in the voting and will go to a runoff on October 19. The elections took place in an environment of relative uncertainty due to the several constitutional actions that tried to stop the process. The electoral process was further marked by structural deficiencies that affected both its transparency and fairness according to reports from international electoral observation delegations, including the European Union and the Organization of American States (OAS).
The persistence of problems such as limited public funding, lack of effective oversight, media polarization, disinformation, and strategic practices of candidate substitution reflect structural deficiencies of the electoral system. While eligibility requirements are generally inclusive, excessively rigid provisions limited access to candidacies. In addition, the high number of disqualifications reflected a complex bureaucracy and a contradictory legal framework. The OAS Electoral Observation Mission highlights that the use of flexible deadlines to replace candidates, inequity in access to the media, and the use of state resources for proselytizing purposes are recurrent practices and pointed to the possibility of disqualifications even after the printing of ballots as a factor of uncertainty. Added to this were media polarization, misinformation and inequity in news coverage. An electoral observation report of civil society, headed by Fundación Jubileo, described as &#8220;worrying&#8221; the levels of insecurity in the pre-electoral stage for civil servants and civilians. This situation motivated the security forces and the Electoral Body itself to work together to guarantee the process. Finally, the law limited indigenous participation to the subnational level, preventing their organizations from competing directly in general elections, which reduced their political influence and national representation.
The event has a significant impact on the enabling environment for democracy and political participation. First, political actors are affected by inequality in access to financing and media. The exclusion of candidates due to bureaucratic procedures weakens equality of opportunity and limits the political offer for voters. Second, the broader citizen&#8217;s engagement with the electoral process and public discourses surrounding the elections are affected. Media polarization and the circulation of disinformation affect the right of citizens to an informed vote. In addition, the exclusion of indigenous organizations from the national level reduces political representation and limits the diversity of voices in public debate.
As a result, there is a sustained erosion of citizen confidence in electoral institutions. The possibility of late disqualifications, the manipulation of deadlines to replace candidates, and the use of state resources for partisan purposes generate perceptions of partiality and weaken the legitimacy of electoral authorities. If this distrust persists, it could translate into a lower level of citizen participation and engagement. The continuity of media polarization can further accentuate social fragmentation, hinder democratic dialogue, and favor narratives that delegitimize the electoral process before and after the elections.

"Humanitarian Aid for Gaza Residents","Event Summary
The New Israel Fund (NIF) has donated more than three million dollars (over 10 million Shekels) in humanitarian aid to Gaza residents. According to the Fund’s announcement, the money will be transferred to three organizations: World Central Kitchen (WCK), Clean Shelter, and the International Rescue Committee, which provide food, water, shelter, and sanitation services.
The donation was motivated by a growing realization among Israelis that the government is not doing enough to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. NIF’s CEO, Daniel Sokatch, stated: “The Israeli government is not allowing sufficient food into Gaza, but as people of conscience, we cannot stand idly by.”
NIF is a veteran civil society organization founded in 1979. Its mission is to promote justice, equality, and democracy in Israel, and a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
NIF and its leadership, in Israel and the United States, are calling for an immediate end to the war in Gaza, the release of all hostages and the pursuit of a diplomatic solution that will end the painful and bloody Israeli-Palestinian conflict and ensure the safety, prosperity, and security of all peoples of the region—Israelis and Palestinians alike.
In their daily work, NIF staff promote equality between all residents of Israel regardless of ethnicity or religion, and work to preserve and strengthen Israeli democracy. They do this by supporting a wide range of civil society organizations through grant making, professional training, and consulting.
A donation designated for humanitarian aid to the residents of Gaza during wartime is seen by some parts of Israeli society as a necessary and important step, while by others as an unacceptable act. Its very existence demonstrates the ability of civil society to take a stand and act on deeply contested issues, even in times of a complex and difficult war.

"Deterioration of Access to Information and Security in the Digital Space in Venezuela","Event Summary
Since the July 2024 elections, a progressive deterioration of the right to freedom of expression and access to a safe digital environment has been documented. In mid-year, the Office of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression reported on this situation in a statement, characterizing it as marked by fear and self-censorship. However, since July 2024, control over the digital space has intensified, along with the use of digital platforms to spread false information and stigmatize activists, journalists, and organizations.
Thus, access to information has deteriorated in Venezuela since the presidential elections of July 2024. This situation has been compounded by the use of social media and news outlets for the dissemination of false information, while stigmatization and accusations of involvement in criminal activities have become commonplace. A notable example is the stigmatization campaign against Cazadores de Fake News and El Nacional on social media. Regarding online access to information, more than a year has passed since the announcement of the blocking of the platform X in Venezuela on 8 August 8 2024.

In July 2025, the Government of Karnataka released a draft of the Misinformation and Fake News (Prohibition) Bill, proposing criminal penalties for spreading misinformation, including jail terms and heavy fines. The bill defines misinformation broadly—covering edited videos, fabricated texts, and even content labeled &#8220;anti-feminist,&#8221; &#8220;obese,&#8221; or disrespectful to &#8220;Sanatan symbols.&#8221; A new state body would be empowered to identify such content, issue takedowns, and enforce penalties.
Critics, including civil society, legal experts, and media groups, have raised strong concerns. They argue that the bill&#8217;s vague language, harsh penalties, and lack of independent oversight create risks of misuse, particularly in politically sensitive contexts. Bail provisions are stricter than usual, and the proposed enforcement authority lacks external accountability, raising fears of selective or politically motivated enforcement.
This draft follows a wider national trend of tightening state control over online speech in India. While the central government has already introduced IT rules and a federal fact-checking system, states like Karnataka are now developing their own frameworks—leading to fears of conflicting laws and increased censorship.
The bill emerged shortly after a spike in disinformation during the India-Pakistan tensions in April–May 2025, which heightened political momentum for regulation. However, legal experts argue that such laws may contradict established constitutional protections, citing cases like Shreya Singhal.
The bill sparked public backlash when leaked in June 2025, in response to which, the Karnataka government has said it will revise the language and consult stakeholders. Still, observers worry that the bill is part of a broader, institutional trend toward curbing digital freedom under the guise of public safety—potentially chilling journalism and free expression across the country.

"Ecuadorian President convenes a Constituent Assembly without following the proper procedure","Event Summary
Through Executive Decrees 148 of 19 September 2025 (later repealed) and 153 of 20 September 2025, President Daniel Noboa called for a popular consultation with the aim of initiating the drafting of a new Constitution. However, by failing to first consult the Constitutional Court on the admissibility of this initiative before submitting it to the National Electoral Council, the President did not comply with the legally established procedure. Noboa’s actions are interpreted as an attempt to undermine the rule of law under the pretext of combating insecurity.
The Foro por la Democracia, a collective composed of experts and academics from across the country, expressed its opposition to President Noboa’s actions and filed a constitutional challenge against the Executive Decree. The collective argued that bypassing the Constitutional Court in order to initiate a constituent process constitutes an attempt to circumvent the democratic institutional order. In response, the President downplayed the Forum’s opinion on social media.
It should be noted that on 20 September 2025, the National Electoral Council decided to forward Executive Decree 153 to the Constitutional Court for consideration, despite this being the President’s responsibility.

"The Superintendency of Banks freezes the bank accounts of social organisations","Event Summary
During the course of the National Strike called by the Indigenous movement on 18 September 2025, the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) denounced the freezing of the bank accounts of the organization Indigenous and Peasant Movement of Cotopaxi (MICC), and several of their leaders. According to a statement published on its profile on the social media platform X, CONAIE reported that the Superintendency of Banks took this measure without following due process and under direct orders from the national government. In the same statement, the Confederation said this strategy responds to an attempt by the government to “criminalize social protest and weaken the demands of the country’s peoples and nationalities.” Civil society organizations such as Yasunidos and Cabildo por el Agua de Cuenca also reported account freezes. Neither the financial institutions nor those affected received any explanation regarding the judicial basis behind the freezes.
In an interview, Minister of the Interior John Reimberg confirmed that the government was aware of the bank account freezes, arguing that they were carried out because the demonstrators “have people behind them who seek to destabilize and provoke chaos.” He later claimed that the account freezes were imposed because foundations were allegedly financing acts of violence. Reimberg did not provide further details or evidence to support these claims.
These measures, taken unilaterally and without following the proper judicial procedure, represent a serious violation of the right to freedom of association and assembly; furthermore, they constitute a setback in the protection afforded to Ecuadorian CSOs against external interference and in their ability to access resources.

"Harassment of human rights defenders and activists working on behalf of persons deprived of their liberty","Event Summary
In the last weeks of September, members of the Baduel family, relatives of Josnars Baduel—who has been detained since May 2020—and members of the Committee of Relatives of Political Prisoners of Venezuela (CLIPPVE), reported new incidents of harassment and intimidation.
During a tour of diplomatic missions in Caracas, called the “Route for Justice and Freedom,” unidentified individuals began following and harassing participants as they visited different diplomatic missions in the city. The purpose of the initiative was to raise awareness and advocate for the situation and release of those arbitrarily detained. According to available information, the harassment was primarily directed at Andreína Baduel, sister of Josnars Baduel and daughter of the late Venezuelan military officer Raúl Baduel, who himself remained in detention until his death in October 2021.
According to the complaint filed by the victim herself, unidentified individuals followed her and even placed a tracking device on the vehicle she was traveling in. These incidents are part of the ongoing pattern of persecution and harassment that has intensified in the country, this time targeting relatives of those detained for political reasons.
The Committee for the Freedom of Political Prisoners brings together activists, human rights defenders, and relatives of individuals detained for political reasons in Venezuela. In recent weeks, the group has been carrying out a small tour, known as the “Route for Justice and Freedom,” visiting diplomatic missions accredited in Venezuela to denounce, raise awareness, and advocate on behalf of political prisoners and their families.

"The State temporarily suspends the signal of a community television channel","Event Summary
On 24 September 2025, the Indigenous and Peasant Movement of Cotopaxi (MICC) and the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador denounced that the signal of the community television channel “TV MICC” was suspended by the Agency for Regulation and Control of Telecommunications (ARCOTEL) with the stated aim of “safeguarding public order and national security.” The suspension will last for 15 days in the cities of Latacunga, Salcedo, Ambato, Cevallos, Quero, Pelileo, Pillaro, and Tisaleo. This measure comes just days after the call for a national strike and social mobilizations against the national government.
Authorities have not provided further details regarding the suspension of the channel’s signal; however, ARCOTEL notified MICC that the report justifying this suspension cites intelligence report STIE-DC-BIC-004, which claims that the station’s broadcasts contained “aspects that harm national security.” This intelligence report is classified, meaning that not even MICC has access to its full content. Both the Indigenous movement and other community media outlets, as well as Fundamedios—an organization dedicated to defending rights and freedoms of expression and the press—have expressed their rejection of this case of censorship and state persecution.
In response to the suspension of TV MICC, advocacy actions should prioritize exerting pressure before judicial bodies or international mechanisms such as the IACHR and the Special Rapporteurs on freedom of expression, accompanied by a legal strategy to challenge the measure before the Constitutional Court. In addition, actions should be developed to support community media that may be exposed to such acts of censorship, as well as Indigenous journalists. Finally, efforts should focus on migrating to alternative broadcasting platforms that can mitigate the impact of future suspensions, ensuring that the voice of the Indigenous movement maintains channels of dissemination in the face of potential new instances of censorship.

"Pakistan Revives Three-Month Preventive Detention under Anti-Terrorism Act, Raising Alarm over Civil Liberties","Event Summary
On 13 August 2025, Pakistan’s National Assembly  passed amendments to the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, restoring preventive detention powers for security agencies. The Senate approved the amendments on 19 August, 2025, and on 31 August, 2025 President Asif Ali Zardari signed them into law.
The amendments allow the police, armed forces, and civil armed forces to detain individuals suspected of terrorism or serious offenses for up to three months on the basis of “reasonable suspicion” or “credible information.” While the law requires detainees to be presented before a magistrate within 24 hours, custody of up to 90 days is permitted for investigation under Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) composed of police and intelligence agencies. A three-year “sunset clause” means the preventive detention powers will lapse unless renewed by Parliament.
The government has argued that by requiring magistrate review, the framework will reduce the practice of enforced disappearances. However, civil society groups and opposition parties warn it risks normalizing arbitrary detention and eroding due process. Critics highlight that vague standards like “reasonable suspicion” undermine constitutional guarantees of liberty and fair trial, and could be weaponized against political opponents, journalists, and human rights defenders. In conflict-affected regions such as Balochistan, the law may legitimize special detention centres and entrench practices that are unlawful under international human rights law.
These developments not only restrict freedoms of expression, association, and assembly, but also intimidate civic actors, and erode judicial safeguards, posing a serious threat to the enabling environment for civil society. The amendments change the Anti-Terrorism Act nationwide, giving security agencies legal cover for preventive detention across Pakistan. While risks are systemic, they may disproportionately impact conflict-affected regions such as Balochistan.

"Two Protesters Killed as Gen-Z Demonstrations Face Violent State Crackdown in Morocco","
On 1 October 2025, youth-led protests in Morocco escalated into violence, resulting in two deaths near Agadir when security forces opened fire on demonstrators attempting to storm a police station in Leqliaa. Unlike past protests led by unions or political parties, this leaderless protest, organized by GenZ 212 and Moroccan Youth Voice via TikTok, Instagram, and Discord, began on September 28 across cities including Rabat, Inzegane, Tiznit, and Oujda. Protesters demanded improved public services, particularly in health and education, criticizing government spending on stadiums for the 2030 FIFA World Cup amid rising social inequality.The unrest has led to over 400 arrests and nearly 300 injuries. Protesters set fire to banks and vehicles, while clashes with police intensified. Civil society organizations, notably the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH), condemned the arrests and called them unconstitutional, citing a broader crackdown on freedom of expression with 37 youths set to stand trial on bail in Rabat. The government has praised the security forces’ “balanced reaction” while framing the two dead protesters as “trouble makers” killed by police in self-defence.  The protests underscore growing frustration with inequality, unemployment (35.8% among youth), and lack of accountability. This situation reflects a clear erosion of freedom of assembly and expression, as protesters have been met with lethal force and widespread detentions. Additionally, the state has publicly demonized protesters while glorifying the actions of security forces, including those responsible for the shootings. This narrative fosters a chilling effect, discouraging civic participation by framing demonstrators as troublemakers and legitimizing violent suppression. The implications for the enabling environment for civil society in Morocco are severe, with heightened risks for activists, reduced public trust, and a narrowing space for peaceful dissent.

"Junta arrests, charges and jails dissents under newly enacted ""Election Protection Law""","Event Summary
Since its enactment on 29 July 2025, the junta has weaponized the &#8220;Law on Protecting Multi-Party Democratic General Elections from Obstruction, Hindrance and Destruction&#8221; (the &#8220;Election Protection Law&#8221;) to systematically arrest, charge, and imprison individuals and groups opposing its planned 2025/2026 elections.
A significant wave of arrests occurred in September 2025, targeting a wide spectrum of society. On 9 September, Ko Nay Thway was sentenced to seven years imprisonment for posting a video questioning the regime&#8217;s ability to hold elections. On 14 September, five individuals from Loikaw, including three minors aged 14, 16, and 17, were arrested under the same law. Subsequently, on 16 September, four men from Yangon were arrested for shouting a popular resistance slogan while riding motorcycles. Further arrests on 19 September targeted two young men for allegedly posting anti-regime stickers. In a significant escalation, the junta confirmed on 27 September that it had charged 11 senior leaders of the Karen National Union (KNU) in absentia for public statements, alongside 17 others including the Chinland Prime Minister and members of the Arakan Army (AA) and the People’s Defence Force (PDF).
These developments illustrate the regime’s use of the Election Protection Law as a tool to criminalize peaceful expression, protest, and political opposition — from grassroots activism to ethnic leadership — further shrinking civic space and undermining democratic participation. As elections approach, it is foreseeable that these crackdowns will intensify, further deteriorating the enabling environment for civil society in Myanmar.

"Violent repression during peaceful demonstrations on 25 September in Antananarivo","Event Summary
On 25 September 2025, a peaceful demonstration organized by municipal councillors in Antananarivo to denounce water and electricity cuts was violently repressed by the security forces. Joined by nearly a thousand citizens, including many young people from the Generation Z Madagascar movement, very active on social media, the demonstrators had planned to gather at Democracy Square in Ambohijatovo (a historic site in the capital and also the designated place for the protest).
The security forces, however, blocked their advance and resorted to what were deemed disproportionate measures. Tear gas, rubber bullets, and even automatic rifle fire (AK-47 type) were reported. According to several media outlets, including France 24, RFI, and TV5 Monde, the violence also targeted journalists present at the scene, some of whom were assaulted while covering the protest.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights issued an alarming initial report: 22 dead and more than a hundred injured on the very first day. On 30 September, the UN office in Madagascar reminded in a statement of the importance of guaranteeing fundamental freedoms and the right to peaceful assembly. The Madagascar Bar Association also condemned the violence in a public declaration.
This crackdown comes in a context of strong social unrest. Persistent shortages of water and electricity have fuelled the anger of an exasperated population. In response to the crisis, the Malagasy president dismissed his government — a decision that underlines the scale of the current political and social tensions.

"Violent repression of 'Gen Z' protest with more than 30 protesters arrested","Event Summary
A youth-led march organized by members of &#8220;Gen Z&#8221; took place on 28 September 2025, in downtown Asunción. The demonstration was called to protest against impunity, corruption, and the misuse of public resources. Despite being peaceful, the event unfolded under a massive police operation involving around 3,000 officers, which the National Police claimed was meant to &#8220;accompany the youth.&#8221;
The march, promoted on social media, gathered around 300 to 400 participants, including both young people and adults. Early on, attendees reported excessive police controls and the arrest of four individuals. Organizers had previously stated that the demonstration was peaceful, unaffiliated with any political parties or NGOs, and unfunded. They also warned of misleading messages online attempting to misrepresent the nature of the protest.
Later that night, the situation escalated. Police reportedly used force to disperse the crowd, deploying officers on motorcycles and in vans, as well as riot units and mounted troops. Human rights groups intervened as confusion grew. By midnight, reports confirmed that 31 people had been detained.
On the morning of Monday, 29 September, while protesters demanded the release of those arrested, the National Police Command stated that their actions were in response to violent behavior by some demonstrators. They also announced plans to deploy even more officers at future protests, indicating a worsening trend of police repression of peaceful protests. It was later revealed that the police had infiltrated social media networks to investigate alleged incitement to commit punishable acts. While the Prosecutor’s Office is investigating the messages on these networks, the interception of private communications was criticized as illegal and reminiscent of the political espionage conducted under Stroessner dictatorship.
By 8 p.m. on the evening of Monday, 29 September, all detained individuals had been released without charges. Meanwhile, the National Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture (MNPT) condemned the excessive use of police force, the lack of judicial warrants for the arrests, and the violation of the constitutional and internationally protected right to peaceful assembly. The Prosecutor&#8217;s office has since then opened a criminal case against the National Police for alleged police mistreatment and the lack of following proper procedures, such as granting the detained protesters a medical inspection.

"""We Do Not Stand Idly By"": Academics for Israel Democracy Launches Third Civic Protest Collection","Event Summary
On 23 September 2025, Academics for Israel Democracy (AID), a group of academics from different institution in Israel established as part of widespread protests against anti-democratic government measures in 2023 published a collection of statements, speeches, and public appeals delivered by academics and civil society activists during protest events, in the media, and in other forums. These are now presented in English to international audiences.
Among the contributions in this collection are speeches against silence and in favor of hope and solidarity. The collection also features declarations by senior Israeli academics. This is the third booklet published by the group.
The publication is part of an effort to preserve and encourage open and meaningful civic discourse that reflects diverse voices in Israel, including opposition voices, despite the desire of some political actors in Israel to erode the freedom of expression and protest of civil society activists.
Prof. Itai Ater, a member of AID stated, “We care about the Israeli hostages, and we also care about the children of Gaza. We are not indifferent to the suffering of others, we do not stand idly by, and we do not remain silent.” AID’s members actively collaborate with both Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel, participating in ongoing civil protests to bring humanitarian and democratic issues—both within Israel and in the occupied territories—into the public agenda.
Alongside their local activity, the academic activists want their voices — and the voices of others in the protest movement — to be heard in the international community.

"September 2025: violent repression trend in Mogadishu","Event Summary
On 24 September 2025, Mogadishu witnessed incidents that indicate violations of citizens’ rights. Security forces violently assaulted a father and mother in the Siinaay neighborhood, prompting a public apology from Police Commander Major General Asad Osman Abdullahi. In addition, clashes occurred between government forces and opposition groups near Siinaay and Dayniile markets, resulting in injuries, casualties, and property damage.
The Somali Federal Government has also been demolishing houses in areas considered government land, displacing residents who were living there. This has led to forced evictions and further restriction of citizens’ access to safe housing and essential services. These actions, combined with violent clashes and attacks on civilians, demonstrate increasing challenges for civil society organizations (CSOs) to operate freely and safely. Citizens’ rights to assembly, expression, and security are under threat, and residents face harassment and uncertainty.
Overall, these events reflect a negative trend in Mogadishu’s political space. The combination of state violence, displacement, and political clashes contributes to a climate of fear and uncertainty. This discourages citizens from participating in civic activities and weakens trust in institutions. Civil society actors may be forced to self-censor or reduce their visibility to avoid being targeted, which limits their effectiveness and reach. There is a need for increased monitoring, documentation of abuses, and coordinated advocacy to protect civic space and ensure accountability.

"Supreme Court dismisses revocation of NGO’s FCRA registration in rare protection of freedom of association","Event Summary
In September 2025, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Central Government of India’s plea challenging the Madras High Court’s directive to renew the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) registration of two Chennai-based NGOs. The Central Government argued that the renewal was denied due to violations of Section 7 of the FCRA, which prohibits transferring foreign contributions without prior approval. However, the courts found no evidence of misappropriation or misuse of funds by the NGOs, remarking that procedural lapses alone did not justify refusal. The Supreme Court rebuked the Central Government&#8217;s for complicating matters and urged compliance with the High Court order, emphasizing that NGOs doing social work should not face undue harassment. The ruling mandates compliance with the renewal order and reinforces procedural fairness in regulatory actions, there by reinforcing legal protections for NGOs, affirming that suspicion without proof of wrongdoing is insufficient cause for denying FCRA renewals.
In recent years and especially the past year, numerous NGOs have faced delays, denials, or cancellations of FCRA licenses, often based on procedural or technical grounds rather than proven misuse of funds. This has resulted in widespread criticism that the regulatory framework is being used to harass and curtail civil society activities under suspicion rather than evidence. The judiciary, through this ruling and others, has increasingly pushed back against the executive’s stringent approach by affirming safeguards for NGOs against arbitrary denial and emphasizing the need for evidence-based actions. The decision marks a rare intervention of the High Court to protect freedom of association with the last decision on a similar matter decided in favor of maintaining the organisation’s FCRA cancellation in 2022.

"Indigenous land defender killed during protest","Event Summary
The national strike in Ecuador began on 18 September 2025, and remains ongoing. At the same time, a state of emergency is still in force, suspending freedom of assembly in the provinces where the largest mobilizations, usually led by the Indigenous movement, are reported.
On 28 September 2025, amid the national strike called in response to the elimination of the diesel fuel subsidy in Ecuador, the Regional Human Rights Advisory Foundation (INREDH) reported the death of Efraín Fuerez, an Indigenous community member who was killed after being struck by a bullet while participating in a demonstration on the Cotacachi-Otavalo road in Imbabura Province. Subsequent reports indicate that Fuerez was shot three times, one of them in the back. While the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) held the Armed Forces and President Daniel Noboa responsible for the citizen’s death, the Government and the Army claimed it was the result of an ambush carried out by protesters against military personnel stationed on the Cotacachi-Otavalo road.
From civil society, INREDH demanded an immediate, independent, and transparent investigation, while CONAIE denounced a pattern of repression and called for continued mobilization in response to the Executive’s measures. For the members of the Cuicocha community, the death of Fuerez—recognized as a pillar of his family and his community—has generated outrage and grief, reinforcing feelings of vulnerability and mistrust toward state institutions and the disproportionate interventions of the armed forces in the context of demonstrations. From the National Government, Minister Zaida Rovira maintained a narrative of criminalizing protest, stating that “what happened in Cotacachi was not protest: it was a cowardly ambush carried out by criminal-terrorist structures that attacked our Armed Forces,” and affirmed that these events would not go unpunished.
The cases of disproportionate repression in the context of the September 2025 national strike in Ecuador do not constitute an isolated event, but rather represent the continuation of a pattern of response to social mobilizations. What distinguishes the current scenario is the consolidation of a more forceful government strategy that has been systematically applied during the most recent administration. President Daniel Noboa has institutionalized the recurrent use of states of emergency through successive decrees, including the one issued on September 16 (Executive Decree 134), setting a precedent of permanent militarization for the control of public order. This strategy has been complemented by unprecedented measures such as the freezing of bank accounts of Indigenous organizations and the suspension of community media outlets, creating a scenario in which social protest is confronted through an expanded repertoire of legal and administrative mechanisms that reflect an escalation in the state’s containment of citizen mobilization.

Defensor indígena de la tierra asesinado durante una protesta
Los casos de represión desproporcionada en el contexto del paro nacional de septiembre de 2025 en Ecuador no constituyen un evento aislado, sino que representan la continuación de un patrón de respuesta frente a las movilizaciones sociales. Esta crisis se enmarca en una secuencia recurrente de protestas desencadenadas por decisiones gubernamentales relacionadas con el precio de los combustibles.
El 28 de septiembre de 2025, en medio del paro nacional convocado como resultado de la eliminación del subsidio al combustible diésel en Ecuador, la Fundación Regional de Asesoría en Derechos Humanos (INREDH) reportó la muerte de Efraín Fuerez, comunero indígena quien falleció tras recibir un impacto de bala mientras participaba de una manifestación en la vía Cotacachi-Otavalo, provincia de Imbabura. Reportes posteriores indican que Fuerez recibió tres disparos, uno de ellos por la espalda. Mientras que la Confederación de Nacionalidades Indígenas del Ecuador (CONAIE) responsabiliza a las Fuerzas Armadas y al presidente Daniel Noboa por la muerte del ciudadano, el Gobierno y el Ejército sostienen que esto fue el resultado de una emboscada que los manifestantes realizaron en contra de militares que se encontraban en la vía Cotacachi-Otavalo.
Desde la sociedad civil, INREDH exigió una investigación inmediata, independiente y transparente, mientras la CONAIE denunció un patrón de represión y llamó a mantener la movilización por las medidas tomadas por el Ejecutivo. Para los miembros de la comunidad de Cuicocha, la muerte de Fuerez, reconocido como pilar de su familia y de su comunidad, ha generado indignación y dolor, reforzando el sentimiento de vulnerabilidad y desconfianza frente a las instituciones del Estado y la desproporción en las intervenciones de las fuerzas armadas en el contexto de las manifestaciones. Por parte del Gobierno Nacional, la ministra Zaida Rovira mantuvo una narrativa de criminalización a la protesta, sosteniendo que &#8220;lo de Cotacachi no fue protesta: fue una emboscada cobarde ejecutada por estructuras criminales -terroristas- que atacaron a nuestras Fuerzas Armadas&#8221; y señaló que los hechos no quedarán impunes.
Los casos de represión desproporcionada en el contexto del paro nacional de septiembre de 2025 en Ecuador no constituyen un evento aislado, sino que representan la continuación de un patrón de respuesta frente a las movilizaciones sociales. Lo que distingue al escenario actual es la consolidación de una estrategia gubernamental más contundente que se ha venido aplicando sistemáticamente durante el último periodo de Gobierno. El presidente Daniel Noboa ha institucionalizado el uso recurrente de estados de excepción mediante decretos sucesivos a los que se sumó el del 16 de septiembre (Decreto Ejecutivo 134), estableciendo un precedente de militarización permanente para el control del orden público. Esta estrategia se ha complementado con medidas sin precedentes como el bloqueo de cuentas bancarias de organizaciones indígenas y la suspensión de medios comunitarios, configurando un escenario donde la protesta social es enfrentada mediante un repertorio ampliado de mecanismos legales y administrativos que reflejan una escalada en la contención estatal de la movilización ciudadana.

"Pachamama Foundation denounces the freezing of its bank accounts and the initiation of a judicial investigation against its president","Event Summary
On 27 September 2025, in the context of the national strike, the Pachamama Foundation, an environmental organization with 27 years of experience in the defense of the Amazon, the rights of Indigenous peoples, and the promotion of regenerative economic models denounced the freezing of the organization’s bank accounts and the initiation of a judicial investigation against its president, Belén Páez. These measures were carried out under the newly approved Organic Law on Social Transparency, which empowers the Financial and Economic Analysis Unit (UAFE) to immobilize the funds of social organizations without prior judicial order (although requiring subsequent validation within eight days). The Pachamama Foundation also pointed out that the impact of this measure extends to the Amazonian communities that benefit from the organization’s projects. All those affected have received notifications from the Office of the Attorney General indicating that a preliminary investigation has been opened for alleged unjustified private enrichment.
This event constitutes a critical alert for the enabling environment, as it reflects a strategy of financial suffocation that undermines the right to property, freedom of association, and due process. Civil society—including local environmental organizations and the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE), which was likewise affected by account freezes in recent days—has denounced these actions as acts of intimidation that criminalize dissent and paralyze community projects, setting a dangerous precedent of using legal tools to silence critical voices.
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;
El 27 de septiembre de 2025, en el contexto del paro nacional, la Fundación Pachamama, una organización ambiental con 27 años de trayectoria en la defensa de la Amazonía, los derechos de los pueblos indígenas y la promoción de modelos económicos regenerativos, denunció el congelamiento de las cuentas bancarias de la organización y el inicio de una investigación judicial contra su presidenta, Belén Páez. Estas medidas se ejecutaron bajo el amparo de la recién aprobada Ley Orgánica de Transparencia Social, que faculta a la Unidad de Análisis Financiero y Económico (UAFE) inmovilizar fondos de organizaciones sociales sin orden judicial previa (aunque requiere validación posterior en un plazo de ocho días). Desde la Fundación Pachamama también señalan que el impacto de esta medida se extiende a las comunidades amazónicas beneficiarias de los proyectos de la organización. Todos los afectados han recibido notificaciones de Fiscalía General del Estado indicando que se ha iniciado una investigación previa por presunto enriquecimiento privado no justificado.
Este evento constituye una alerta crítica para el entorno habilitante, pues configura una estrategia de asfixia financiera que vulnera el derecho a la propiedad, la libertad de asociación y el debido proceso. La sociedad civil, incluyendo organizaciones ambientales locales y la Confederación de Nacionalidades Indígenas del Ecuador (igualmente afectada por bloqueos bancarios en días pasados) ha denunciado estas acciones como actos de intimidación que criminalizan la disidencia y paralizan proyectos comunitarios, estableciendo un peligroso precedente de utilización de herramientas legales para silenciar voces críticas.

"President declares a State of Emergency in seven provinces; suspending freedom of assembly","Event Summary
On 16 September 2025, President Daniel Noboa declared a new state of emergency in Ecuador amid reactions across several parts of the country to the elimination of the diesel subsidy (in place since 1974) and mobilizations opposing mining projects in Quimsacocha, Azuay Province. The state of emergency decree was focused on the main provinces of Carchi, Imbabura, Pichincha, Azuay, Bolívar, Cotopaxi, and Santo Domingo, where a greater number of road blockages were reported, under the argument that these were hindering the normal development of citizens’ personal, economic, commercial, and work activities. Through Executive Decree 134, the freedom of assembly was suspended for 60 days, prohibiting gatherings in public spaces at all hours of the day. The decree also empowered the Armed Forces and the National Police to prevent and disperse meetings in public spaces.
Following the publication of Executive Decree 134, in the seven provinces where the measures were focused, the right to freedom of assembly was suspended with the stated aim of limiting gatherings of people in public spaces intended to paralyze public services or block transportation routes. Despite clarifying in the decree that the measures did not imply restrictions on the right to peaceful protest, demonstrations led by students and teachers’ unions—such as those held on September 16, which sought to march toward the city center in opposition to government measures—were intercepted by members of the Armed Forces, who dispersed them using tear gas and stun grenades.
In response to the elimination of the subsidy, several demonstrations have taken place in Ecuador, which have been repressed by law enforcement, resulting in the detention of at least 10 people participating in protests across different parts of the country. The main protest hotspots have been concentrated in the provinces of Carchi and Quito, where groups of heavy transport workers and citizens have blocked access roads to these cities. The executive branch announced that measures would be taken against people obstructing public services, applying maximum penalties. In his statements, the president said: “No union leader should try to pressure us by threatening to cut off the water supply. Anyone who does so will be charged with terrorism and could face up to 30 years in prison.

"Cancellation of an NGO's foreign contributions license signals increased scrutiny for CSOs in conflict-affected regions","Event Summary
On 25 September 2025, India’s Ministry of Home Affairs cancelled the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) license of SECMOL, the NGO founded by renowned Ladakh-based climate activist Sonam Wangchuk, citing alleged financial violations and activities against the “national interest.” The ministry flagged transactions including improper deposit of locally generated funds in the FCRA account, foreign funds for research on migration and sovereignty, and incomplete declaration of multiple bank accounts. The action followed a period of unrest in Ladakh, where protests for statehood turned violent, resulting in casualties, and the government blamed Wangchuk for inciting demonstrators.
Since its separation from Jammu &amp; Kashmir in 2019, Ladakh has seen growing unrest over demands for local autonomy, tribal rights, and constitutional safeguards, led by groups like the Leh Apex Body and Kargil Democratic Alliance. In September 2025, delayed government negotiations and worsening hunger strikes led to violent protests, deaths, and a crackdown, highlighting deep tensions between regional aspirations and central government control.
The CBI and tax authorities initiated further investigations into SECMOL and related organisations, scrutinizing fund transfers from Sweden and alleged mismanagement. Wangchuk and his colleagues argued that the funds were intended strictly for educational and food sovereignty programmes and characterized the government’s interpretation as a misreading. The move is part of a broader pattern, with thousands of NGO FCRA licenses cancelled under regulatory scrutiny in recent years.
The cancellation of SECMOL’s FCRA license stands out due to its direct connection with recent violent protests in Ladakh over statehood demands, escalating the political sensitivity around the organization. The cancellation not only restricts SECMOL&#8217;s ability to receive foreign funds but also symbolizes a broader attempt to curb civil society activism perceived as aligned with dissent. Unlike some other cancellations based purely on compliance technicalities, the government framed it as national security and public order concern linked to the protests and “provocative statements,” marking a more explicit political dimension and raising serious concerns about the deteriorating enabling environment in conflict-affected regions of India.

"Mali’s ICC Withdrawal: A Blow to Democracy and Civil Society","Event Summary
Mali&#8217;s withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC) marks a worrying step in the deterioration of the human rights situation and democratic governance. This decision of 22 September 2025, announced by the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), deprives citizens and civil society of an essential international mechanism for combating impunity for the most serious crimes, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is part of a broader trend towards the concentration of power and the restriction of civic space under the banner of national sovereignty. This trend is characterised by the postponement of elections indefinitely, the dissolution of political parties, the repression of independent media and the arbitrary detention of various actors.
In this context, the Malian people find themselves deprived of fundamental guarantees, both nationally and internationally, in the face of abuses and potential violations of their rights. The gradual closure of channels for citizen participation and accountability undermines the legitimacy of institutions and increases the risk of impunity. United Nations experts have called on Mali to reconsider its decision and to remain in the ICC. the withdrawal thus symbolises a major setback for democracy, justice and the rule of law in Mali.

"Civil Society Organisations Raise Alarm Over Restrictive Draft Law on Associations","Event Summary
On 25 September 2025, eight prominent human rights organizations — including Human Rights Watch, EuroMed Rights, OMCT, CIHRS, and the Foundation for the Promotion of Rights in Algeria (FPRA) — issued a joint press release urging Algerian authorities to lift unjustified restrictions on civil society and to thoroughly revise the draft law intended to replace Law 12-06 on Associations. The draft bill, currently under review, proposes a burdensome registration regime (including requirements for bailiff certification and high thresholds for founding members), expands the discretionary powers of the Ministry of the Interior (including unrestricted inspections, control over funding, and administrative suspensions), and introduces vague clauses such as “national values” and “national unity” — terms that could be arbitrarily used to suppress civil society activities. Civil society actors argue that the draft law contradicts Article 53 of Algeria’s Constitution, which guarantees a declarative regime for associations, and violates international and regional standards, including Article 22 of the ICCPR, Article 10 of the African Charter, and the ACHPR Guidelines on Freedom of Association. This legislative development follows other restrictive measures in 2025, including revisions to the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Law on General Mobilisation, all occurring in a broader context of shrinking civic space. The signatory organizations have called for the draft law to be withdrawn or substantially revised, and for genuine consultation with civil society stakeholders. These developments signal a looming deterioration of the enabling environment for civil society in Algeria, particularly affecting freedom of association, expression, and registration, and risk further isolating civil society from democratic processes.

"CSO shut down due to Foreign Agents Law","Event Summary
As part of an ongoing closure of operations by civil society actors, three prominent civil society organisations (CSOs) announced either their closure or their withdrawal from implementing projects, citing the deteriorating political environment and the impact of the Foreign Agents Law.
On 5 September 2025, FESPAD, a leading organisation established in 1988, announced its closure. It stated that the law creates legal uncertainty for CSOs and renders operations financially unsustainable, particularly due to the 30% tax on foreign funding and donations, alongside the risk of sanctions and intrusive oversight.
Similarly, on 8 September 2025, FUDECSO announced its dissolution after 33 years of work, arguing that the law has made their continued existence “inviable.” The organisation described the law as a form of censorship and expressed concerns about persecution, harassment, and arbitrary arrests carried out under the country’s ongoing state of exception.
In addition, on 16 September 2025, the Journalists’ Association of El Salvador (APES) announced it would no longer implement projects funded by international cooperation. The organisation explained that the Foreign Agents Law creates an untenable legal and financial framework for such initiatives, and that continuing would expose them to undue risk.
These developments underscore the worsening enabling environment for civil society in El Salvador, where restrictive laws, financial barriers, and the prolonged state of exception are creating a climate of fear and making independent civic action increasingly unsustainable.

"Arrest of activists during forced removal of the Auditor General","Event Summary
On 15 September 2025, police arrested four activists during a press conference condemning the removal of the Auditor General from office. The police forcibly removed Auditor General Momodou Ceesay from the National Audit Office after he rejected President Adama Barrow&#8217;s appointment of him as Trade Minister. Plain-clothes police officers attempted to arrest Ceesay and install his successor, but staff members initially blocked them until reinforcements arrived to escort Ceesay out. Ceesay, appointed in 2022, had overseen high-profile audit reports exposing government irregularities and calling for tighter spending controls.
The activists were arrested outside the National Audit Office protesting Ceesay&#8217;s removal. Police Intervention Unit officers reportedly used tear gas indiscriminately to disperse the crowd and prevent journalists from covering the event. Four activists; Kemo Fatty, Alieu Bah, Momodou Camara, and Omar Saibo Camara, were subsequently charged with unlawful assembly and common nuisance.
The forced removal and arrest of protesters represent a significant escalation in tensions between civil society activists and the government over accountability and anti-corruption efforts.

"Amparo Law Reform - Risk to Effective Access to Justice","Event Summary
On 15 September 2025, the President of the Republic submitted to the legislature a bill to reform the Amparo Law. While the proposal includes fiscal aspects and other relevant topics, the amparo trial has been a central instrument for the defense of rights in Mexico. Among the substantial modifications, the change in the definition of “legitimate interest” stands out, which in practice restricts the ability of individuals, communities, and civil society organizations (CSOs) to file collective amparos, especially in environmental, social, and Indigenous matters.
The government argues that the reform seeks to reduce abuses and streamline processes; however, various CSOs, bar associations, and collectives have warned that the changes are regressive and put effective access to justice at risk.
The legislative debate included public hearings that concluded on September 30, with minor adjustments to the concept of “legitimate interest.” Nevertheless, the process was marked by limited civil society participation and a fast pace that hindered thorough analysis of the impacts of a reform of such significance.
The most alarming development occurred on 1 October 2025, when the Senate approved the reform with minimal changes and, at the last minute, added a transitory article establishing the retroactive application of the law, extending its effects to amparos already in process. This decision has caused significant concern across many sectors, as it is seen as a serious setback in access to justice without real checks and balances, in a context where the Supreme Court of Justice is closely aligned with the political control of the ruling party. The reform is now moving to the next stage, but everything indicates that it will be approved without significant modifications in the coming days.

"Disputed union leadership transition raises concerns over interference","Event Summary
On 14 September 2025, the executive committee of the Autonomous Central of Workers of Panama was removed as a result of a general assembly, which, according to its general secretary, failed to comply with the union&#8217;s bylaws. The congress was convened to elect a new Executive Committee (Board of Directors), but only six of the eighteen member organisations participated. Article 16 of the CGTP statutes stipulates that the call for a National Workers’ Congress must be issued either by the Executive Committee itself or by at least half plus one of the affiliated organisations. Despite this requirement, the Ministry of Labour and Workforce Development (MITRADEL) promptly recognised the congress and approved the change in the CGTP’s Board of Directors.  Additionally, the general secretary was the subject of a complaint filed by another union leader, who accused her of honor crimes. The criminal case was dismissed by a judge who considered it lacking in evidence. The union leader maintains that this is not an isolated incident, but rather part of a broader strategy against the Panamanian union movement.  
This raises concerns about potential weakening of workers’ collective organising and political interference in internal union processes. Such developments can undermine the enabling environment for civil society by eroding organisational autonomy, reducing trust in democratic governance structures, and restricting the ability of labour unions to operate freely and independently.

"Mass Arrests of Protesters After the August 2025 Demonstrations","Event Summary
Between 25 and 29 August 2025, large-scale protests took place across Indonesia, prompting a heavy police crackdown starting September 1. Over 3,000 protesters from various backgrounds, including activists, students, academics, and ordinary citizens have been arrested, and there have been reports of at least 10 deaths and numerous injuries. Authorities have also conducted sweeps beyond protest sites, detaining people in their homes and communities. Among those detained were Delpedro Marhaen (Executive Director of the Lokataru Foundation), Mujaffar Salim, Syahdan Husein, and Khariq Anhar, who were accused of inciting violence and encouraging protests. Several others were arrested for social media activities, such as promoting protests or making controversial videos. In addition, some protesters continue to be missing, and there were reports of digital threats and doxing.
The arrests and repression by the authorities have raised concerns about the shrinking of civic space in Indonesia. Activists and civil society groups have been advocating for the release of detainees, with some protesters going on hunger strikes in protest. The government has not effectively addressed the excessive use of force against demonstrators, and no significant measures have been taken to hold law enforcement accountable.
This crackdown on free expression, mass arrests, and surveillance is seen as a growing trend that suppresses opposition and political speech, furthering authoritarian tendencies in the country. The repression has had a &#8220;chilling effect&#8221; on public participation and dissent, increasing political exclusion and polarization, and eroding confidence in democratic institutions. The criminalization of activists and peaceful protesters poses a threat to civil society, undermining the right to free speech and assembly.

"The NGO Proética receives historic recognition from the Supreme Court as an aggrieved party in a corruption case","Event Summary
In September 2025, the Supreme Court&#8217;s Special Investigation Chamber notified Proética of its recognition as an aggrieved party, setting a historic precedent: it became the first civil association to be acknowledged as representing citizens affected by corruption. On 7 January 2025, Proética had requested authorization from the Public Prosecutor’s Office to participate in the criminal investigation against President Dina Boluarte and other officials for the alleged crime of aggravated collusion, related to the preferential treatment of suppliers in social programs run by the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion (MIDIS), such as Qali Warma. The aim was to represent the beneficiaries who were directly affected by this act of corruption.  The Public Prosecutor’s Office denied this request, so Proetica turned to the Supreme Court’s Preparatory Investigation Chamber through a rights protection remedy. Following the hearing held on May 6, Proética was officially recognized as an aggrieved party. 
The UNCAC Coalition’s Working Group on Victims of Corruption highlighted the significance of this achievement, stating: “The Peruvian Supreme Court’s decision resonates far beyond Latin America. At a time when restrictive laws and political pressure are shrinking civic space worldwide, this ruling affirms the essential role of NGOs in ensuring that corruption cases reflect the voices and rights of those most affected”. 
This ruling sets a clear precedent affirming that civil society organizations have legal standing to defend vulnerable citizens’ rights. By recognizing Proética as an aggrieved party, the Supreme Court reinforces their vital role in safeguarding the public interest, aligned with Constitutional Court jurisprudence, the UN Convention against Corruption, and Article 94(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

"Parliament Dissolved, Interim Government Formed with Mandate to Conduct Election","Event Summary
After a period of serious political and social crisis and three days of arduous negotiations, former Chief Justice Sushila Karki was appointed as Nepal’s 42nd Prime Minister, leading an interim government on 12 September 2025. This critical agreement, reached among key stakeholders including the President’s Office, the Nepali Army, Gen Z leaders, and major political parties, culminated in her appointment under Article 61 (4) of the constitution. Given that she is not a Member of Parliament, her selection deviates from the usual constitutional provision requiring the Prime Minister to be from within the parliament, highlighting the extraordinary circumstances.
Immediately following her appointment, Prime Minister Karki declared parliamentary elections to be held on 4 March 2026. The existing House of Representatives was dissolved upon her recommendation late Friday night, while the National Assembly will remain intact. The new Prime Minister has constituted a small cabinet comprising non-political public figures. This formation follows widespread anti-corruption protests by Gen Z youths, initially ignited by a social media ban. The government’s initial response involved extreme suppression, resulting in at least 74 deaths including 3 police fatalities. Hospitals were overwhelmed with hundreds of injured. This escalating violence and public outcry led to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s resignation, as key political leaders proved unable to manage the crisis. While the protests have ceased, significant disruptions to public services and governance structures persist, indicating a challenging period ahead for the public until normalcy is restored.
Civil society and political parties have largely expressed gratitude to the President for de-escalating the Gen Z protest, yet they have simultaneously raised serious concerns regarding the dissolution of a parliament that had over two and a half years remaining in its tenure. The NGO Federation of Nepal, along with other civil society organizations and networks, has issued press releases arguing that this action could negatively impact democracy and freedom of expression by dissolving the people’s representation office. They have also suggested the formation of an independent body to investigate government suppression during the protests and to address the core issues raised by Gen Z. Civil society groups are emphasizing the need to ensure peace, human rights, and the protection of children from violence. They are also working to create pressure on the government and major political parties to negotiate and address the demands of Gen Z.
Key recommendations include:

Engage with the interim government to ensure the timely conduct of parliamentary elections as declared, minimizing the period of vacuum and transition.
Advocate with political parties to integrate and prioritize issues related to civic space, freedom of expression, and the voices of marginalized communities into their upcoming election manifestos and political agendas.
Emphasize the importance of upholding and protecting constitutional principles during this transitional period, particularly concerning the separation of powers and democratic norms.
Establish a monitoring mechanism to track human rights violations, ensure accountability for past abuses, and promote the rule of law during the interim period and electoral process.
Support initiatives that facilitate constructive dialogue between political stakeholders, civil society, and Gen Z representatives to foster reconciliation and build a consensus for future governance.
Launch a public awareness campaign on the importance of democratic participation, constitutional rights, and peaceful civic engagement, especially targeting youth.

"Chile Advances Structural Reform of Law No. 20.500 on Associations and Citizen Participation in Public Management","Event Summary
Chile is advancing a structural reform of Law No. 20.500 on Associations and Citizen Participation in public management, originally enacted in 2011. While the law represented a milestone in formalizing participatory mechanisms, its impact has been limited: implementation has been uneven across institutions, mechanisms remain mostly consultative, and historically excluded groups—women, Indigenous peoples, youth, and persons with disabilities—have lacked meaningful inclusion. To address these deficits, the government launched the “Let’s Talk About Participation” process (2023–2024), engaging over 6,600 citizens, civil society leaders, experts, and local officials, whose recommendations shaped the reform proposal.
The bill, submitted to Congress in August 2025, defines participation as a legal right and strengthens the institutional architecture for its implementation. It introduces binding principles (accessibility, equality, transparency, territorial relevance), establishes deliberative and decision-making influence mechanisms, such as participatory dialogues, strengthens the COSOC with elected presidencies and binding consultative functions, and establishes annual participation plans in all public institutions. It also modernizes the Civil Society Strengthening Fund to ensure parity, decentralization, and accountability. If approved, the reform would mark a decisive shift from consultative to binding participation, generating a substantive improvement in the enabling environment for civil society.

"Government maintains Decree 366/2025 restricting migrants' rights and participation in civic life","Event Summary
In late August 2025, a federal court declared part of the Decree of Necessity and Urgency 366/2025 unconstitutional in a specific case. Despite this, the government holds onto the decree and has appealed the ruling. Decree 366/2025 was published on 29 May 2025 and introduces substantive changes to the Migration Law No. 25,871 (2004). Among other points, it expands the grounds for inadmissibility and expulsion even without a final conviction, reduces the deadlines and appeals, and establishes new economic, educational and health requirements to access residency and citizenship. The decree was issued without opportunities for civil society participation, preventing democratic dialogue in the formulation of this public policy. Instead, the law was pushed through in an autocratic way reducing institutional spaces for CSOs to act as watchdog of the state.
Civil society organizations and experts have denounced that the Decree violates constitutional rights and international treaties, including the MERCOSUR Social and Labour Declaration, by restricting the rights of migrants to basic rights such as access to health and higher education, toughening naturalization and facilitating expulsions without due process. It is also feared that the reforms will aggravate the conditions of access to citizenship and increase the discretion of Migrations in controls and expulsions. The effects are already being observed: in the first three months of 2025, 157 expulsions were recorded, the highest average in two decades. Reported cases show a disproportionate impact on trans people and sex workers. Family separations were also documented, such as the case of an Afro-Uruguayan worker deported despite residing in Argentina for more than 10 years.
The decree replaces the human rights approach of Migration Law 25,871 with a security and exclusionary approach, which negates the human rights-based principles on which many CSOs base their actions. This regulatory change marginalizes and disempowers the voice of rights organizations. By linking migration issues with national security, terrorism and criminality without providing any evidence to that effect, the government promotes a narrative that stigmatizes organizations that work with migrants or vulnerable communities, weakening their public legitimacy and making their work more difficult. As a result of the restriction of basic social rights of migrants, CSOs are further overburdened and without effective legal tools to protect affected population. For migrant organizations, DNU 366/2025 not only violates due process, but also aggravates the social and civic exclusion of migrant and LGBTIQ+ communities, reinforcing historical patterns of discrimination and limiting their full participation in public life.

"Judicial harassment of Daraj Media","Event Summary
Since 2023, Daraj Media and its staff have faced at least 14 lawsuits, largely initiated by banks, political figures, and affiliated lawyers. The number of cases increased significantly in 2025, coinciding with Daraj’s investigative reporting on the Central Bank of Lebanon, financial misconduct, and money laundering involving political elites. Plaintiffs include high-profile figures such as Antoine Sehnaoui and Omar Harfouch. These cases display the characteristics of SLAPP suits, designed less to succeed on merit than to drain resources, intimidate journalists, and constrain investigative reporting. Daraj reports that the lawsuits divert substantial time and effort, forcing the outlet to shift energy from journalism to legal defense, although no rulings have been issued against it so far. The outlet relies on international solidarity networks (OCCRP, ICIJ, Reporters Shield) for protection, but the trend highlights systemic weaknesses in Lebanon’s legal framework. The proliferation of such cases represents a significant escalation in efforts to silence watchdog journalism during a critical moment of financial collapse and accountability demands.

"Journalist Umu Thoronka’s case goes to ECOWAS Court","Event Summary
Women in the Media Sierra Leone (WIMSAL) and RFK Human Rights have jointly filed a petition to the Community Court of Justice of ECOWAS on behalf of Umu Thoronka, a Sierra Leonean journalist. Ms. Thoronka was dismissed from her role at the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) in July 2024 after SLBC executives ordered her termination. This action followed her posting of a TikTok video documenting a troubling incident at a Presidential Town Hall Meeting, where a woman was publicly silenced for questioning President Julius Maada Bio about the escalating cost of living and food prices. SLBC management labeled the video as critical of the President, leading to Ms. Thoronka’s dismissal.
Local civil society organizations such as WIMSAL condemned the dismissal as unconstitutional and have revealed that this case is emblematic of a broader pattern of gender-based violations against female staff at SLBC, adding that the dismissal not only undermines journalistic independence and freedom of expression but also signals a shrinking space for civic engagement and accountability which disproportionately affects female journalists and activists. These civic groups have called for government to uphold the rights of journalists across Sierra Leone.

"Hong Kong artist Chan King-fai receives suspended sentence for ""freedom"" graffiti","Event Summary
On 6 September 2025, Hong Kong artist Chan King-fai received a three-week suspended jail sentence for four counts of criminal damage related to graffiti depicting Chinese characters for &#8220;freedom&#8221; combined with dollar signs in Kwai Chung and Sha Tin in 2023. Chan, representing himself, pleaded guilty and told the court he created the design in late 2022 to symbolize his desire for financial freedom. This marks his third prosecution for the same graffiti design. In June 2025, he received a similar three-week suspended sentence for 12 counts in Central and Sheung Wan, and in December 2023 received one-year probation for 20 counts. Magistrate Andy Cheng noted the cases should ideally have been handled together but police discovered the graffiti at different times, resulting in separate prosecutions totaling 36 criminal damage charges.
This event is part of an established pattern of prosecuting graffiti in Hong Kong, with enforcement varying in severity depending on content. In July 2024, an 18-year-old was charged with sedition for toilet graffiti containing words that &#8220;provoked hatred&#8221; against the government, facing up to seven years imprisonment under national security legislation. This demonstrates that graffiti prosecutions can range from property damage charges to national security offenses. The pattern shows systematic enforcement against unauthorized public markings, with authorities treating graffiti as criminal activity regardless of content, though political or potentially symbolic language can trigger more severe charges.

"Junta increases airstrikes on schools in resistance-held areas, escalating child casualties","Event Summary
The Myanmar junta has systematically conducted airstrikes and aerial attacks targeting educational facilities and schoolchildren across multiple states and regions, resulting in mass civilian casualties, predominantly children. Between May and October 2025, verified attacks on schools in Tabayin, Kyauktaw, Kawkareik, Kyaukkyi, Mindat, and Hakha townships have killed over 75 children and teachers and injured hundreds more. Key recent incidents include the 13 October attack in Hakha Township, Chin State, that killed two children and injured over 20, the 8 October strikes in Mindat Township, Chin State, that killed three children and a disabled woman, and the devastating 12 September attack on boarding schools in Kyauktaw Township, Arakan State, that killed 22, mostly schoolchildren.
These attacks frequently occur in resistance-held areas where there is no ongoing fighting at the time, indicating the strikes are deliberate. The strategy has forced the widespread closure of schools, instilled profound fear in communities, and catalyzed a humanitarian adaptation, with civilians and civil society organizations constructing subterranean, bomb-proof schools and clinics to protect children and continue education underground. The junta routinely denies responsibility or falsely claims these civilian structures are legitimate military targets.

"Independent bookstore ""Book Punch"" forced to cancel events following numerous anonymous complaints and accusations of ""soft resistance”","Event Summary
On 18 September 2025, Hong Kong independent bookstore &#8220;Book Punch&#8221; revealed that it has been forced to cancel multiple events over the past two months due to anonymous and false complaints. The bookstore disclosed that complainants send emails to employers, universities, funding bodies, and award organizations threatening event speakers, resulting in top-down pressure forcing cancellations. In one case, a new book launch was cancelled and the bookstore was prohibited from selling the book after complaints reached the funding organisation. Book Punch stated that five categories of people can no longer participate in their sharing events: professionals, university staff, funded project organisations, award recipients, and shops or service suppliers. This followed a July 21, 2025 front-page attack by pro-Beijing newspaper Wen Wei Po, after which schools received emails from &#8220;concerned citizen Ms. Zhang&#8221; urging Education Bureau Secretary Christine Choi to blacklist Book Punch. The complaint emails, sent to school principals&#8217; associations and Hong Kong schools, accused the bookstore of selling books like &#8220;Jimmy Lai Biography&#8221; that &#8220;smear the government and National Security Law,&#8221; fundraising for the Journalists Association, and displaying QR codes for court coverage publications, claiming these constitute &#8220;soft resistance&#8221; challenging national security. Book Punch vowed to continue despite these pressures, while supporters like the &#8220;Migratory Bird&#8221; group (supporting prisoners and families) expressed solidarity.

"Hong Kong police summon family members of two additional ""Hong Kong Parliament"" activists for questioning","Event Summary
On 11 September 2025, Hong Kong police summoned Ng Chiu-fai, 55, father of wanted activist Agnes Ng, to Sheung Shui Police Station for questioning. On 16 September 2025, police summoned the mother of wanted activist Hau Chung-yu, 56, to Tsuen Wan police station for investigation. Both activists are among 15 individuals with HK$200,000 bounties issued in July 2025 for participating in the &#8220;Hong Kong Parliament&#8221; elections and swearing-in ceremony. Agnes Ng, 28, left Hong Kong on July 17, 2020, and was accused of taking part in the election and virtual swearing-in as a parliamentarian. Hau Chung-yu, 31, was similarly accused of participating in the election and being sworn in as a winner. These mark the fourth and fifth occasions where authorities have summoned immediate family members of the 15 wanted activists. The pattern continues the established practice of questioning relatives of overseas activists following the July 2025 bounty announcements, extending pressure beyond the wanted individuals to their families remaining in Hong Kong. This practice obstructs and inhibits contact between family members, as relatives overseas face threats and reprisals when attempting to communicate with their loved ones in Hong Kong. The family questioning creates an environment where maintaining normal family communication becomes dangerous, effectively preventing relatives overseas from exercising their right to communicate with family members without fear, as highlighted by UN Special Rapporteurs in their joint allegation letter to the Chinese government.

The application also challenges the authorities’ decision to place his name on a “movement monitoring list” maintained by the police and Immigration Department, which subjects him to questioning each time he travels overseas. The restriction was linked to an ongoing investigation into a satirical artwork criticising Sabah Governor Tun Musa Aman.
The June incident followed an earlier denial of entry into Sabah on 29 May 2025, when Fahmi was stopped upon arrival at Kota Kinabalu International Airport. Days later, on 7 June, he was prevented from flying to Singapore after being informed that “police clearance” had not been granted. The following day, the IGP denied any official travel ban but admitted Fahmi was under movement monitoring. On 12 June, after Fahmi flagged discrepancies in his travel status between the Immigration Department’s English and Malay portals, the Department clarified that he could travel overseas but not to Sabah, attributing the inconsistency to system updates. The police and Immigration Department did not issue an apology to Fahmi for the restriction imposed. Both the May and June travel bans were linked to police investigations on the same satirical artwork.
In his affidavit, Fahmi argued that placing his name on a movement monitoring list constituted restrictions on his liberty, privacy, and freedom of movement. He maintained that the authorities had no lawful power to impose such monitoring or subject him to questioning at airports, in the absence of active investigation or pending criminal processes against him. Fahmi also contended that the authorities’ lack of transparency and arbitrary enforcement breached his rights under Article 8(1) of the Federal Constitution. Case management is fixed for 30 October 2025.

"Fact checkers face intimidation and online defamation amidst heightened electoral polarisation","Event Summary
Between 27 September and 10 October 2025, Bolivian fact-checking platforms Bolivia Verifica and Chequea Bolivia, along with independent journalist Joaquín Martela, were targeted by smear campaigns and threats. These attacks followed their verification of racist tweets from 2010 linked to Juan Pablo Velasco, vice-presidential candidate of Alianza Libre. Though Velasco denied the authenticity of the tweets and called it a political attack, the fact-checkers confirmed the tweets came from an account registered to his party.
The verification triggered online harassment, intimidation, and legal threats, with Chequea Bolivia receiving 24 social media attacks in just under two weeks. The campaign has been deployed not only through comments, but also through televised interviews, videos and private messages that have dismissed the work of the fact-checkers. Martela also faced threats of legal action. These actions are part of a broader pattern of political cyberbullying, particularly in a context of economic crisis, political polarization, and rising disinformation in Bolivia.
Journalistic and civil society organisations, including the National Association of Journalists of Bolivia and the National Coalition to Combat Electoral Disinformation, condemned the attacks and expressed support for the fact-checkers.
A report noted that Bolivia Verifica identified 442 pieces of disinformation on social media from January to August 2025, underscoring increasing political polarisation and the crucial role of fact-checkers during elections. However, increasing digital harassment and smear efforts threaten to censor or silence journalists and undermine public trust in reliable information sources.
Cyberbullying of journalists, media outlets and rights defenders is a constant reality, although little reported. Between January and June 2025, the UNITAS Human Rights Observatory has identified six cases of cyberbullying against journalists, mainly linked to their investigative work. The actors from which these attacks come are in some cases public officials linked to the complaints and in other cases anonymous users.
In the long term, if adequate protection and regulation measures are not adopted against disinformation and digital harassment, this type of attack could consolidate a structural pattern of political harassment that weakens the media&#8217;s oversight role and restricts citizens&#8217; right to access truthful information, thereby hampering their ability to participate in political decision-making.

"DRC government delegitimizes HRDs and promises to Deny HRDs Humanitarian Aid","Event Summary
In October 2025, several human rights defenders (HRDs) from North and South Kivu provinces, who were displaced to Kinshasa due to ongoing armed conflict in eastern DRC, publicly denounced the alleged embezzlement of USD 4 million by government—funds they claim the government had allocated for their humanitarian assistance. In response, on 7 October 2025, the communication officer for the Minister of Human Rights issued a public statement dismissing the HRDs’ claims as a “media campaign hatched by agencies close to Rwanda.” He further emphasized that the funds would not be allocated to “individuals grouped around personalities close to Rwanda and ready to spit on the interests of the Republic”—a pointed reference to human rights defenders, who will be excluded from accessing these resources. Civil society’s role in oversight and advocacy is weakened by accusations of foreign allegiance which delegitimizes civil society actors who speak out against corruption or mismanagement, particularly in conflict-affected regions. The government&#8217;s framing of the HRDs as foreign-influenced and anti-national not only undermines their credibility but also creates a hostile environment for civil society, especially for displaced activists seeking accountability.

"Press Freedom Under Threat as Cases of Harassment and Assault on Journalists Continue to Increase","Event Summary
On 30 September 2025, Zambia witnessed an escalating trend of threats to press freedom in Zambia, following an incident in which Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) journalist Mark Ziligone and Prince Malupande of Laka FM were assaulted by a uniformed officer, believed to be a commando, while covering a traffic accident on Lilayi Road in Lusaka. Despite displaying valid press credentials, the officer ordered them to stop filming, physically assaulted Ziligone, confiscated his phone, and deleted photos, while his colleague was also shoved and threatened. The journalists later described the experience as traumatic and a stark reminder that even accredited media professionals are vulnerable to arbitrary violence. This incident have been widely condemned by local actors, including the Media Liaison Committee (MLC), the Lusaka Press Club, and other media freedom advocacy organisations. They have denounced the actions as illegal and called on the government to swiftly end what they describe as ongoing harassment, intimidation, and attacks on journalists by law enforcement officers. This incident builds on previously reported incidents such as the arrest and detainment of journalist Thandizo Banda on 25 August 2025 and the 18 September 2025 assault of Prime TV reporter Christopher Bazilio Banda by police officers while doing his duties. Together, these events reflect a growing pattern of harassment and intimidation by state security and intelligence operatives, which is contributing to a deteriorating enabling environment for civil society, particularly in the areas of media freedom and access to information.

"Journalists attacked by security forces during demonstrations","Event Summary

During the National Strike called by the Indigenous movement and various social organizations, as of 15 October 2025, more than 50 cases of aggression against journalists by the National Police have been documented by civil society organisations defending freedom of expression. In different parts of the country, reporters have been victims of searches (such as Jorge Cano, from Wambra Medio Comunitario), physical assaults (Santiago Gil, from Ecuavisa), verbal attacks, and pressure to delete audiovisual material (Pamela Ledesma, from BN Periodismo), among other forms of violence. On October 14, the case of Edison Muenala, a journalist from the community channel Apak TV, was reported — he was shot in the shoulder and required urgent medical attention.

These cases of aggression against journalists reveal a systematic pattern of violations of fundamental civil rights and freedoms — particularly freedom of expression and press freedom — by the Ecuadorian State, in response to the demonstrations held in recent weeks and justified under the state of emergency declared due to “serious internal unrest.”
Organizations defending freedom of expression, such as Fundamedios, Fundación Periodistas Sin Cadenas, and various community media outlets, have expressed concern over the excessive use of force against journalists covering the protests across the country. They have called on the authorities to initiate investigations and sanction those responsible for violating press and expression freedoms.

"The freezing of bank accounts associated with environmental organisations continues","Event Summary

On 13 October 2025, through its X account, the environmental collective Yasunidos denounced the blocking of the bank account of its legal coordinator, David Fajardo, without prior notification or a court order, amid growing financial and judicial restrictions against organizations in Ecuador. This incident adds to similar account freezes that occurred during the national strike called by the Indigenous movement, as well as other cases such as those reported by the Pachamama Foundation, which also experienced the freezing of its accounts. The affected organizations claim that these actions are intended to obstruct their work defending the rights of nature and Indigenous communities that have been repressed during these demonstrations.

"Swearing-In of Zambia’s Constitutional Review Technical Committee Raises Hopes for Civil Society","Event Summary
On 14 October 2025, President Hakainde Hichilema swore in a 25-member Technical Committee to lead nationwide consultations and propose amendments to Zambia’s Constitution, following its formal establishment on 2 October under Articles 92(1), 92(2)(f), and 92(2)(j). Chaired by retired Supreme Court Judge Christopher Mushabati, with Dr. Lindiwe Banda as Vice Chairperson and Spokesperson, the Committee includes representatives from the judiciary, civil society, academia, traditional leadership, faith-based groups, and legal professionals. President Hichilema emphasized that the process must be inclusive, consultative, and cost-effective, aiming to reflect the voices and lived experiences of all Zambians.
The swearing-in comes after sustained public and civil society critique of Bill 7 of 2025, which many argued was fast-tracked with inadequate consultation and limited transparency. The pushback from CSOs, faith-based organizations, legal associations and citizen groups had urged the government to adopt a broader, participatory approach instead of rushing predetermined outcomes.
Civil society issued a joint statement which cautiously welcomed the swearing-in as a milestone in terms of ensuring inclusiveness but emphasized that the process will only be seen as legitimate if it adheres to key principles, including transparent Terms of Reference, open access to draft documents, inclusive consultations at all levels, protection for dissenting voices, independence from political influence, and meaningful participation of women, youth, persons with disabilities, and marginalized communities. This has been reiterated by a coalition of Faith Based Organizations. If conducted transparently, the constitutional review process could contribute to fostering a more supportive political culture—one that encourages meaningful state engagement with civil society organizations in policymaking and promotes inclusive dialogue in governance.

"Public sector unions secure salary increment deal for civil servants","Event Summary
Following weeks of engagement and follow-up visits to government offices by the Swaziland National Association of Teachers (SNAT) and other Public Sector Unions (PSUs) since 6 October 2025, the Government of Eswatini has officially issued a response confirming a salary increment deal for civil servants.
This development comes after prolonged negotiations and advocacy efforts by the unions, who had initially submitted a petition in July 2025 as published in our Early Warning Mechanism in July 8 demanding a salary review to address the rising cost of living and inflation. The government’s decision marks a significant milestone for civil servants, reflecting a partial response to the unions’ long-standing demands.
Leaders of Public Sector Unions (PSUs) pinned their signatures on the 2025 Salary Review Collective Agreement reached in the evening of 15 October 2025 in Mbabane. The agreement included a 100% implementation of the basic salary scales as recommended by the Salary Review Consultant (Emergence Human Capital), a 15% backpay and resort to Notch 1. All consequential Allowances and the 85% backpay shall be paid in July 2026. An Appeals Procedure shall be elaborated in the Establishment Circular to be issued soonest. The new Scales shall be effected beginning this October 2025. The Eswatini Government allocated only E800 Million for the 1st Phase of the Salary Review Exercise.
The announcement has been received positively among union members and the broader civil service, though discussions continue around the adequacy and sustainability of the increment in light of ongoing economic challenges.

"Protests by the People's Congress and Stigmatization of the Right to Social Mobilisation","Event Summary
Throughout October 2025, the Congreso de los Pueblos (People&#8217;s Congress) — a social movement that brings together farmers, indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants and other grassroots organisations — led multiple days of protest in cities and territories across the country. The demonstrations have included roadblocks, occupations of public buildings and demands for land, housing, ethnic rights, compliance with agreements and security against armed groups. At the same time, government and institutional authorities have in some cases claimed that the demonstrations have been infiltrated by criminal or paramilitary structures, or have characterised the protests as a source of disorder. This dual dynamic, the persistent mobilisation of communities and the criminalisation or stigmatisation of such protests, poses a crucial challenge to the full guarantee of the right to association, demonstration and citizen participation.
These demonstrations have taken place amid a climate of growing stigmatisation of social protest, with several official spokespeople and media outlets associating the demonstrations with disorder or armed infiltration. Despite statements by the UN and the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office defending the legitimacy of peaceful protest, the country still lacks a statutory law that clearly regulates the exercise of this right, leaving wide margins of discretion for the authorities and increasing the vulnerability of those who mobilise for social and territorial causes.

"Increase in participation in the 2025 national elections for municipal and local youth councils","Event Summary
On 13 October 2025, elections were held for municipal and local youth councils in Colombia, a participatory mechanism created by Law 1622 of 2013 and amended by Law 1885 of 2018. According to the Registrar&#8217;s Office, nearly 1.4 million young people voted, representing 12.8% of the youth electoral roll. Although there was a slight increase compared to previous elections (10.4%), abstention remains very high and the low representation of rural youth and ethnic sectors is a cause for concern. However, it is considered a success that this space continues to develop as a contribution to democracy in the country.
Municipal Youth Councils are a mechanism for citizen participation for young people elected by popular vote. Young people between the ages of 14 and 28 are eligible to vote. Their role is to act as intermediaries with local public authorities to influence public policies on youth issues. In each municipality, councillors are elected to form the Councils. Their size varies depending on the municipality. Supported by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, with the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office playing a key role, these spaces are considered to be of great importance. They contribute to youth-focused political decision-making at the local level and contribute to the development of a democratic culture.

"Excessive police force, arrests and injury of journalists during a youth-led protest","Event Summary
On 15 October 2025, nationwide demonstrations organised by the so-called Generation Z (young Peruvians without belonging to any specific group or movement), culminated in violent clashes between protesters and the National Police. The protests followed the impeachment of former President Dina Boluarte and the inauguration of José Jerí as President of the Republic, deepening Peru’s ongoing political crisis.
The confrontations left over 80 people injured, including civilians and police officers, and resulted in the death of 32-year-old Eduardo Mauricio Ruiz Sanz. Protesters demanded the president’s impeachment, changes to the congressional board of directors, decisive action against extortion and contract killings, and stronger anti-corruption measures. Tensions escalated when the police blocked side streets along Abancay Avenue and used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. In retaliation, some protesters set fire to objects on the street.
The National Association of Journalists (ANP) reported that at least 11 journalists were injured, while the Ombudsman’s Office confirmed detention of 10 protesters. In response, the Human Rights Coordinator (CNDDHH) called for the immediate release of the arbitrarily detained youths, as well as respect for due process and their fundamental rights.
Despite these reports, Interior Minister Vicente Tiburcio defended police actions as necessary to “safeguard the right to protest,” while noting that officers had also been injured.
The violent repression of recent demonstrations and the state’s heavy-handed response have further deteriorated Peru’s enabling environment for civil society. These actions have undermined citizens’ ability to exercise fundamental rights, particularly the freedoms of peaceful assembly, expression, association, and political participation.

"Attack against two Venezuelan activists exiled in Bogotá","Event Summary
On 13 October 2025, two Venezuelan activists exiled in Colombia, Yendri Velásquez (LGBTIQ+ activist) and Luis Alejandro Peche (political consultant), were attacked with firearms in Bogotá. Both had fled political persecution in Venezuela and were in Colombia seeking protection or refuge. This event highlights the growing vulnerability of Venezuelan human rights defenders in exile in the country and the challenges faced by the Colombian State in guaranteeing their protection.
Both are in stable condition and the Colombian government has expressed its determination to clarify the facts. This situation is part of the Venezuelan migration to Colombia that has been ongoing for several years. Some of the migrants belong to the political opposition and have sought protection in Colombia. The State has sought to provide guarantees.

"Personal Data Protection Bill passed at Chamber of Deputies risk restrictions of the right to access information","Event Summary
On 14 October 2025, the Chamber of Deputies ratified its version of the Personal Data Protection Bill. The Bill was first introduced in Congress in 2021 and one of the modifications made in 2025 (introduction of Article 24) has been widely criticised for its potential negative impact on the right to access information. Specifically, CSO specialists and sectors of the opposition have pointed out that the law contradicts rights established under the Law on Access to Public Information and the Law on Access to Information about the Remuneration of Civil Servants and risks undermining transparency as it “could become a tool of arbitrary use to deny access to information of public interest”. The controversial Article 24 of the draft law establishes that access to information in public sources may be denied or limited with the opposition of the public official from whom information is requested, who has five working days to file an opposition to the request for access.
Following criticism, the Senate had modified Article 24 during its deliberations in August 2025 with the reformulated version establishing that access to public information could be denied &#8220;only when the damage caused to the protected interest is greater than the public interest in obtaining access to the information,&#8221; but leaving the evaluation of the case to the discretion of the corresponding state agency or entity. Despite these modifications in the Senate version, the Chamber of Deputies ratified the original version with the undue restrictions on access to information in place.
For the law to enter into force, it needs to be passed by the Senate and then approved by the Executive. Discussion at the Senate have recently been postponed. While the law is necessary to protect personal data and has undergone an extensive path of elaboration with contributions from civil society organizations, the warning about a reduction in transparency need to be heeded to protect the enabling environment and it will be up to the Executive Branch to consider this once it is sanctioned by Congress.

"Attempts to Restrict Artistic Freedom","Event Summary
The Ministry of Culture and Sports announced a film competition for Israeli filmmakers (October 5, 2025) following the Minister, Miki Zohar’s, intention to cancel government funding to the long-running Ophir Awards, granted by the Israeli Academy of Film and Television, which selects the Israeli representative for the Oscar Awards  in the Best International Feature Film category. Zohar’s initiative to withdraw funding from the Ophir Awards came after the win of the film The Sea, which, according to him, portrays IDF soldiers in a false and defamatory manner.
The Sea, directed by Shai Carmeli Pollak, tells the story of Khaled, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy from a village near the city of Ramallah, who tries to reach the sea for the first time in his life during a school trip but is sent back home at a military checkpoint due to an expired entry permit while his classmates continue on the trip.
In March 2025, Minister Zohar called on cultural institutions to boycott the Israeli-Palestinian documentary No Other Land, which won the 2025 Oscar Award for Best Documentary Feature. Following this, the ministry’s legal adviser issued a clarification stating that the minister has no authority to intervene in cultural content or to revoke public funding based on the views expressed in artistic works.
The Israeli Academy of Film and Television, whose standing the new award seeks to undermine, is a CSO that has been promoting Israeli film and television production domestically and internationally for over 35 years. Among other things, the Academy is responsible for the Ophir Awards, the Israeli equivalent of the Oscars. This is not the first time that the Minister of Culture and Sports has acted—or called for action—to deny financial support to CSOs that provide a platform for works or opinions he perceives as contrary to government policy.

"Restrictive anti-NGO law enters into force causing widespread concern among CSOs","Event Summary
On 23 October 2025, President Santiago Peña passed Decree 4806 regulating and thereby puting into effect Law 7363 on control, transparency and accountability of Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs). This law, dubbed &#8220;Anti-NGO Law&#8221; or &#8220;Garrote Law&#8221; by civil society had been enacted in November 2024 and was awaiting subsequent regulation for more than eleven months, creating widespread uncertainty for civil society organizations concerned about the impending entry into force of this law. Pro-government parliamentarians had demanded for its regulation, arguing that there is need for increased transparency from CSOs.
The law has been widely criticized for placing undue restrictions on the right of association. Key concerns include:

Broad categories of organisations subjected to the law, defined as all those that receive national or international public and private funds and that participate in public policies, understood, among other things, as those public actions &#8220;(&#8230;) that contribute, influence or have a direct impact on the approval of regulations of general scope&#8221; (Art. 4).
Excessive state control over non-profit organizations (NPOs), with duplicative registration requirements and harsh penalties for non-compliance.
Vague and ambiguous language that leaves room for broad interpretation and abuse, potentially threatening the operational independence of CSOs.
Risks to the privacy and security of individuals within civil society organizations, as well as those they support.
The law may also discourage media outlets from criticizing the government, given the potential for punitive measures.
The regulatory uncertainty and restrictive environment created by the law are expected to have a paralyzing effect on civil society and to discourage international donors from engaging in Paraguay

The law thus subjects CSOs to arbitrary state oversight without proper avenues for defense, undermining their autonomy and role in promoting human rights, democracy, and social welfare. CSOs warn about the discretionary control embedded in the law that enables its targeted use against civil society actors critical of the state. The law is seen as a tool for state surveillance, rather than a transparency mechanism, and could be used to silence opposition voices, especially those critical of the government.
Different national civil society actors and international organizations have warned of negative consequences for the exercise of fundamental freedoms and democratic rights, including Codehupy, TEDIC, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, several UN Special Rapporteurs, Amnesty International, the Latin American and Caribbean Network for Democracy (Redlad) and the Committee to Protect Journalists.
With the entry into force of the law, CSOs are required to register with the Integrated System for the Administrative Registration and Control of Legal Persons, Legal Structures, and Final Beneficiaries within 90 days with those already registered required to update their information within 30 days.
The entry into force of Law 7363 was celebrated by politicians from the ruling party, while sectors of the opposition have once again pointed out a clear government intention to silence those who may present critical voices. CSO leaders have indicated that they will proceed to study the regulation and are preparing further actions, including filing an action of unconstitutionality before the Supreme Court, requesting precautionary measures, and pursuing strategic litigation to protect fundamental freedoms of association and expression.

"Renewed Government Attacks on the Law Association Following Chief Justice Appointment Dispute","Event Summary
On 24 October 2025, Prime Minister Kamla Persad‑Bissessar again publicly attacked the Law Association of Trinidad and Tobago (LATT), this time after it criticised the rushed appointment of Ronnie Boodoosingh as Chief Justice. The LATT warned that the process appeared to violate Section 102 of the Constitution, which requires the President to consult both the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition. Instead of addressing these constitutional concerns, the Prime Minister dismissed the Association’s legitimacy, referring to its leadership as “eat‑ah‑food filth” and declaring she had “no regard” for their position.
This episode directly follows an earlier incident on 7 July 2025, when the Prime Minister and her party, the United National Congress (UNC), publicly condemned the LATT for defending Independent Senators in a constitutional debate. At that time, the UNC’s press office accused the Association of hypocrisy, “anti‑democratic behaviour,” and misrepresenting the Constitution.
Taken together, these events illustrate an ongoing pattern of state hostility toward a core civil society institution fulfilling its watchdog role. Such attacks also distort public understanding of the legitimate roles of CSOs, reinforcing a perception that advocacy or accountability equals political opposition. The latest attack, framed around judicial appointments, deepens concerns that civil society actors who question governance processes face political retaliation and reputational harm, thereby weakening the enabling environment for independent oversight.

"Violence and polarising discourses affect enabling environment ahead of November elections","Event Summary
Ahead of the general elections scheduled for 30 November 2025, the political environment in Honduras has become characterized by polarisation and a worrying increase in electoral violence. Political campaigns increasingly rely on messages that incite violence, hatred, and aggression. This climate of violence, including the assassination of candidates for public office, limits human rights and directly violates the essential principles for an enabling environment for civil society. A report by the National Autonomous University of Honduras warns of an increase in political violence in a context marked by electoral uncertainty including the partisan capture of electoral institutions, attempts to destabilise the National Electoral Council, and the state’s inability to ensure transparent elections and sanction illegitimate political financing. They highlight specifically attacks on democratic principles such as citizen participation, freedom of expression, and the separation of powers.
The level of violence embedded in the campaigns of candidates perpetuate the perception of politics as a violent battlefield, rather than an arena of legitimate debate, constructive and safe dialogue to find consensus on development proposals. It negatively affects civic culture by generating distrust and apathy among citizens, creating an environment of fear that limits the participation of different actors, especially human rights defenders.
The role of organised civil society will be crucial in the coming weeks to act as an essential counterweight to state power and to protect and restore democratic principles. Civil society actors need to monitor and document abuses of power, corruption, human rights violations, and non-compliance with the law by officials and institutions, conducting investigations and demanding transparency in the use of public funds. Strengthening democracy in the long term requires an informed and active citizenry. To achieve this, civil society actors should design and implement educational and citizen awareness campaigns, develop programs to educate the public about their rights, the principles of democracy and the functioning of the rule of law, and ensure that citizens have access to information, which is vital to counter disinformation and propaganda.

"Financial Intelligence Centre warns civil society over illicit finance","Event Summary
While speaking at a brief on civil society compliance with the Financial Intelligence Act on 9 October 2025, the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) warned civil society organisations, including faith-based groups, that they remain vulnerable to being used for money laundering and terrorism financing. The FIC director Bryan Eiseb said: “We cannot shy away from the fact that some civil society organisations are being misused for illicit purposes. You must know your sources of funding. If they are legitimate, that protects your organisation’s integrity.” He urged CSOs, churches, and other non-profit groups to register with the FIC and to declare their income sources in annual filings. Eiseb did say he viewed civil society, churches, community organisations and other non-profits as strategic partners in the fight against money laundering as CSOs were &#8220;guardians of transparency.”
The meeting was initiated by the Civil Society Information Centre which approached the FIC. The reason for the meeting stemmed from an attempt to avoid the confusion that arose in 2023 when the FIC threatened to have the bank accounts of non-profits closed if they did not complete the forms required by law.

On 11 October 2025, Admire Bio-Jalloh, President Bio’s niece, has threatened the safety and life of renowned journalist and presenter of the Morning Devotion programme on Truth Media after he mentioned the Sierra Leone Police Press Release in April 2024 informing the public of an investigation on allegations of Kush against Admire. Admire then took to social media hurling insults at Lamrana, and her husband can be heard in the background threatening to beat up the journalist. His employer, Truth Media, Sierra Leone Association of Journalist (SLAJ), and Media Reform Coordinating Group (MRCG) have all come out to condemn the actions of Admire and husband, with a formal complained being made by Lamrana against them.
In a Morning Devotion programme on Truth Media on 10th October 2025, Amadu Lamrana Bah questioned the impartiality of the Sierra Leone Police (SLP), after they put out a wanted notice for Natasha Beckley, with allegations that her property is under investigation on illegal drugs allegation. He compared the handling of Natahsa’s notice, who is a member of the opposition All Peoples Congress Party (APC), to Admire’s situation last year, where the SLP put out a notice to inform the public of their search at Admire’s residence, after allegation of her being the kingpin for the Kush trade emerged.
Sierra Leone Association of Journalist (SLAJ), Media Reform Coordinating Group (MRCG), and his employer Truth Media have all come out to condemn the utterances and threats by Admire and husband, on Lamrana’s life and safety. According to them, these threats and insults are not only disrespectful and dangerous but also a direct attack on press freedom and freedom of expression: fundamental rights guaranteed under the 1991 Constitution of Sierra Leone.

"Technical Committee Releases Terms of Reference That Mirror Bill 7 – A Step Back for Democracy","Event Summary
On 3 October 2025, President Hakainde Hichilema appointed a Technical Committee to conduct wide-ranging public consultations and draft amendments to the Constitution of Zambia. On 21 October 2025, the Government released the Terms of Reference (ToRs) for the technical committee. These ToRs are presented as a guide for the national consultation but closely mirror the rejected Bill 7. Instead of starting a truly open and people-driven process, the ToRs appear to be a new method to push forward the same controversial changes. These changes would allow the executive to gain more control over key state institutions, including Parliament, the Electoral Commission, and the judiciary. This has raised serious concerns among civil society, which sees it as a disguised attempt to reintroduce Bill 7.

"Controversy Over Cancellation of Church Prayer Event Highlights Concerns over Freedom of Assembly","Event Summary
A planned overnight prayer gathering scheduled to take place at OYDC Zambia – Sports Development Centre, a mini sports stadium on the eve of Zambia’s 61st Independence Day, was cancelled, sparking widespread commentary and public concern. Initial reports circulating on social and independent media platforms claimed that the police had stormed the venue and forcibly cancelled the event. However, according to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Information and Media, Thabo Kawana during an interview on the Hot FM radio, the police did not cancel the gathering but the church leadership itself decided to postpone the event after receiving a formal advisory from the Zambia Police, which recommended rescheduling the gathering due to heightened national security operations and state functions, including the flag hoisting ceremony and presidential banquet. He emphasised that President Hakainde Hichilema respects freedom of worship and that there was no government intention to interfere with religious gatherings. Despite this clarification, public debate remains divided, with some insisting the advisory constituted indirect pressure that influenced the church’s decision.

"Somaliland Police Raid on Consilient Research Organization","Event Summary
On 20 October 2025, the Somaliland Police Force raided the premises of Consilient Limited Company, a research organization operating in Somaliland, and arrested its management and staff. The police stated that the arrests were based on allegations that Consilient was conducting activities against the sovereignty of the Republic of Somaliland. However, following an internal investigation by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), the allegations were found to be false and based on fabricated online propaganda.
On 21 October 2025, the Police Department issued an official clarification confirming that the accusations were baseless and that Consilient was not engaged in any anti-state activities. The authorities also launched an investigation to identify individuals responsible for spreading the false information on social media.
The incident caused temporary disruption to Consilient operations and raised concerns within the civil society community regarding operational security and government suspicion toward NGOs. While the police later clarified the situation, no official apology or statement confirming the release of detained staff has been issued as of the reporting date. This event highlights the growing challenge of misinformation and its potential impact on civic operations, freedom of association, and trust between authorities and civil society in Somaliland.

"Restriction of rights and strengthening of police control during the state of emergency in Lima and Callao","Event Summary
On 21 October 2025, President José Jerí declared a 30-day state of emergency in Metropolitan Lima and Callao to address the ongoing crisis of violence and extortion affecting the country. The Supreme Decree stipulates that the National Police of Peru and the armed forces will assume control of internal order, granting them the authority to intervene at any time and temporarily suspend certain constitutional rights, including freedom of movement, assembly, and the inviolability of the home. The decree also prohibits the transportation of two adults on motorcycles as a crime-prevention measure, restricts visits to prisons in Lima and Callao, and requires prior authorisation for mass religious, sporting, and cultural events. 
In a message to the nation, the President stated that the country is moving “from defense to offense” in the fight against insecurity. He also emphasised that “wars are won with actions, not words.” However, he did not specify which concrete measures against crime would be implemented. 
For their part, youth organisations denounced the measure as an attempt to suppress social protest following the killing of Eduardo Ruiz during the October 15 demonstration. Furthermore, the National Human Rights Coordinator warned that the state of emergency undermines the rule of law and restricts fundamental freedoms. 
In a context of growing social protest, this measure risks being used as a pretext for arbitrary arrests and other violations against individuals who express criticism of the government. Moreover, the involvement of the armed forces in internal security tasks heightens the risk of human rights violations, particularly if proportionality, transparency, and effective oversight mechanisms are not ensured.

"Global Media and Information Literacy Week","Event Summary
Between 23 &#8211; 24 October 2025, the city of Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) hosted a global conference organised by the Colombian Government in conjunction with UNESCO, entitled &#8220;Think Before AI&#8221;. With this event, Colombia positioned itself as the host of a global debate on the principles and challenges of the ethical use of artificial intelligence, resulting in a renewed global commitment to ensuring that access to information, digital education and artificial intelligence is provided under the principles of ethics and inclusion. Five continents and delegations from 23 countries participated in the event, with around 1,000 people in attendance.
While the conference allows for joint reflection and the development of strategies for the future, the ethical frameworks remain disconnected from local realities of inequality, digital access, and fundamental rights. Additionally, global debates remain mere rhetoric and fail to address the real gaps in capacity, data, infrastructure and governance in the country.

"Colombia's Constitutional Court asks President Gustavo Petro not to stigmatise women journalists","Event Summary
On 20 October 2025, the Constitutional Court released a statement on its ruling SU-432 of 2025, which requires the President to refrain from using stigmatising language toward female journalists—such as referring to them as “mafia dolls,” as he did on 30 August 2024. The Court highlighted that such expressions contribute to the vulnerability of female journalists, especially when confronted with powerful public discourse. The ruling further emphasised that, due to the President’s high office, he is subject to heightened responsibilities regarding his freedom of expression and the influence of his public statements. The judgment has been welcomed by local civil society organisations, which released a press statement urging full compliance with the ruling, viewing it as a step toward fostering respectful treatment of journalistic work across all spheres of power.

"Hong Kong police summon brother of ""Hong Kong Parliament"" activist Paul Ha for questioning","Event Summary
On 9 October 2025, Hong Kong police summoned the 72-year-old brother of wanted activist Paul Ha Hoi-chun to Tseung Kwan O Police Station for questioning. Paul Ha, 60, is among 15 activists with HK$200,000 bounties issued in July 2025 for participating in the &#8220;Hong Kong Parliament&#8221; elections and swearing-in ceremony. Ha emigrated to Taiwan in the 1990s and briefly returned to Hong Kong in 2011 to participate in protests against the government budget, blocking traffic on Hong Kong Island and clashing with police. He was accused by national security police of taking part in the election and virtual swearing-in alongside nine other activists including Chin Po-fun, Hau Chung-yu, and Alan Keung Ka-wai. This marks the sixth reported occasion where authorities have summoned immediate family members of the 15 wanted activists following the July 2025 bounty announcements. The pattern demonstrates continued systematic questioning of relatives of overseas activists, extending pressure to family members remaining in Hong Kong. As highlighted by UN Special Rapporteurs in their joint allegation letter to the Chinese government, this practice obstructs and inhibits contact between family members, as relatives overseas face threats and reprisals when attempting to communicate with their loved ones in Hong Kong, creating an environment where maintaining normal family communication becomes dangerous and effectively preventing relatives overseas from exercising their right to communicate with family members without fear.

"Government agencies halt Strengthening Governance and Civil Society Programme alleging subversive activities","Event Summary
The Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) has temporarily paused its Strengthening Governance and Civil Society Programme (GCSP) activities in Uganda after the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) and the National Planning Authority (NPA) requested a halt pending clearance from the Attorney General.
Security agencies raised allegations that GCSP funds were tied to subversive activities and violated national laws and presidential directives on foreign funding. This suspension comes amid rising political tensions ahead of the 2026 general elections.
The pause reflects a broader pattern of Ugandan government crackdowns on foreign-funded civil society and governance programs, especially before elections, as seen in 2021. It severely disrupts civil society organizations (CSOs) dependent on GCSP support—cutting off funding, technical assistance, and training—leading to halted programs, layoffs, and risks of deregistration under the NGO Act (2016).
The move is expected to a further deterioration of the enabling environment, heighten state control over foreign funding, and weaken democratic oversight, transparency, and advocacy—particularly for marginalized groups. Analysts warn this could institutionalize government dominance over civil society, echoing the 2021 Democratic Governance Facility (DGF) collapse that led to widespread NGO closures.

"Transition to a military-led government; and call for inclusive dialogue by civil society","Event Summary
On 12 October 2025, following weeks of nationwide protests marked by violence and repression, President Andry Rajoelina fled Madagascar, claiming to have survived an assassination attempt. His departure was soon followed by the flight of the President of the Senate, creating an institutional vacuum at the highest levels of the state. This development came amid escalated tensions between the government and protesters demanding political reforms, better governance, and an end to corruption and impunity. Demonstrations in major cities  &#8211; including Antananarivo, Antsiranana, Toamasina, Mahajanga, Toliara and Fianarantsoa &#8211; intensified after security forces used excessive force against civilians. The army later joined the protesters and announced that it has taken over power.
On 14 October 2025, the High Constitutional Court declared the offices of the President of the Republic and the President of the Senate vacant. The same decision appointed Colonel Michael Randrianirina as Head of State. He was officially inaugurated on 17 October 2025 as President of the Refoundation of the Republic of Madagascar, marking the establishment of a new transitional authority under military leadership. The National Assembly nominated Herintsalama Rajaonarivelo as Prime Minister of the Refoundation on 20 October 2025, and efforts to form the transitional government are ongoing.
The transition has introduced some uncertainty regarding democratic accountability and the rule of law. Civil society organisations have expressed concern that the military-led refoundation process could concentrate power and restrict oversight mechanisms established during previous democratic transitions. Civil society actors, including pro-democracy networks and human rights groups, have called for an inclusive dialogue to ensure that the transitional process safeguards civic freedoms and sets clear timelines for a return to constitutional order.

"NHRC Orders Probe into Journalists Assaults in Kerala, Manipur, and Tripura","Event Summary
On 22 October, 2025, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of India issued a press release announcing that it has taken suo motu cognizance of three separate attacks on journalists that occurred in Kerala, Manipur, and Tripura in late August and September 2025. The assaults involved violent attacks during professional duties and resulted in hospitalisation for all victims. The NHRC has instructed the Directors General of Police from each state to submit detailed reports, emphasizing the necessity of protecting journalists to uphold democracy and transparency.
The Commission stated that the attacks reflected a declining trend in media safety and urged states to strengthen protections for journalists. Over the past year, there has been an upward trend in violence, intimidation, and harassment targeting media personnel in India, especially in politically sensitive and conflict-affected regions. These incidents reflect broader issues of threats to press freedom, civil rights, and the safety of civil society actors amid rising political tensions and societal unrest. Similar attacks have been reported periodically across different states, often with escalating severity, indicating an erosion of media safety norms and civic protections.
The NHRC’s action underscored the press’s vital role in upholding democracy and transparency and the need for accountability from authorities in preventing such recurring violence. It also reiterates the Commission’s commitment to safeguarding press freedom and demanding strong protection measures for media personnel. The Commission’s actions thus constitute an important opportunity for strengthening the respect for and protection of freedom of expression in India

"Assault on journalists amid the Kashmir protests","Event Summary
During the Kashmir protests in Islamabad in early October 2025, a violent incident occurred when, on 2 October 2025, police forces raided the National Press Club, one of Pakistan’s most prominent journalist institutions. The confrontation began as members of the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC) held a protest outside the club against rising inflation and governance issues in Azad Jammu and Kashmir. When clashes erupted between the protesters and law enforcement, police entered the Press Club premises, reportedly attacking journalists, breaking furniture, and damaging media equipment inside the building. Eyewitnesses and videos circulating on social media showed officers dragging journalists and assaulting staff in the cafeteria area.
The incident was widely condemned by journalist unions, human rights organizations, and political activists, who called it an unprecedented attack on press freedom in Pakistan. The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) and the Islamabad Press Club administration termed it a direct attempt to intimidate the media and restrict journalists from covering civic unrest. Many described the Press Club as a “safe space for free expression” and expressed outrage over its violation by state forces. Protests by journalists were held in multiple cities demanding accountability and protection for media workers.
In response to the outcry, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi ordered an official inquiry into the raid, promising that those responsible would be held accountable. However, conflicting narratives emerged: police officials claimed they acted in pursuit of protesters who had taken refuge inside the building, while journalists insisted that the raid was deliberate and disproportionate. The investigation remains ongoing, but the event has already reignited national debate over the shrinking space for independent journalism and freedom of expression in Pakistan.
Over the past year, multiple incidents have shown intensifying pressure, harassment, and violence directed at journalists and media organizations in Pakistan. For example, journalists have been killed, forcibly disappeared, or threatened, even under ambiguous legal pretexts. Controversial laws such as the proposed social media regulation law are considered attempts to censor reporting. In institutional terms, raids, detentions, and disruptions of press operations have already occurred in Pakistan. Prior to the Islamabad Press Club assault, journalists and press facilities in Quetta among other places had reportedly faced aggressive raids or obstruction. The recent raid on the Islamabad Press Club thus fits into a trajectory of escalating state-media confrontation, especially under conditions of protest, unrest, or political sensitivity.

"Restrictions on Social Organizations in the New Organic Law Regulations","Event Summary
On 28 October 2025, the Office of the Presidency issued the General Regulations to the Organic Law on Social Transparency. The regulation, composed of 74 articles, includes provisions that prohibit organizations from intervening, “directly or indirectly,” in activities aimed at “obstructing or interfering with legally authorized mining projects.” Organizations that fail to comply may have their legal status suspended for up to four years (Article 4, sections 6 and 7 of the Regulation).
The regulation also prohibits the use of national or international funds to “promote, finance, or carry out actions intended to halt mining activities or mining rights established under the Mining Law” (General Provision Six). Moreover, it requires that organizations implementing projects related to the monitoring or auditing of mining activities limit their work “exclusively to those objectives” (General Provision Seven).
These provisions constitute a violation of the right to freedom of assembly and association, while also putting at risk environmental and community organisations that raise legitimate concerns about the impacts of mining on their territories.
So far, there has been no official statement from social organizations or collectives, although the issue has begun to receive coverage in media outlets close to these sectors.

"Activist Ayman Sanduqa’s felony charge and prison sentence for critical Facebook post upheld by military court","Event Summary
Ayman Sanduqa, a former teacher and secretary-general of the dissolved Rescue and Partnership Party, was arrested in December 2023 after posting a Facebook letter criticizing Jordan’s relations with Israel and calling for the annulment of the Wadi Araba peace treaty.
In February 2024, he was charged before the State Security Court with inciting against the political regime (Article 149) and sentenced to five years in prison in January 2025. Although the Court of Cassation later ruled the post constituted the lesser offense of insulting the king (Article 195), the State Security Court overturned that decision on 15 September 2025, reinstating his felony conviction.
His arrest and sentencing have been widely criticized by Jordanian civil society, with over 300 public figures signing an open letter and protests held in solidarity.

"Detention of Students and Journalist for Carrying Out Academic and Informational Work in Venezuela","Event Summary
On 31 October 2025, news broke of the arrest of four students and audiovisual producers near the Tocorón Penitentiary Center, one of the most well-known detention facilities in the country, located in Aragua State in central Venezuela. The four students had taken some photographs of the prison’s façade as part of their thesis project when they were detained.
According to information shared on social media by human rights defenders and international organizations, the students were approached by the prison’s security personnel, who confiscated their identification documents and equipment, and informed them they would be subjected to questioning. They were later transported in patrol vehicles belonging to the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN), and their whereabouts remained unknown.
Human rights organizations and defenders later announced the release of all four students on 3 November 2025, after nearly three days in detention, during which their families had no knowledge of their location.
A similar case occurred during the last week of October, when a crime reporter was reportedly approached by unidentified individuals near his residence in Caracas. According to accounts gathered by journalists’ unions and human rights organizations, the journalist was released several days after his detention.

"Se declara fin del estado de excepción decretado para reprimir manifestaciones sociales","Event Summary
On October 22, 2025, after several weeks of social mobilizations, the president of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE), Marlon Vargas, announced the end of the National Strike through a statement shared on social media. In the video, he called on the bases of indigenous communities to cease mobilizations and clear the roads, while also urging support for the “No” option in all four questions of the Popular Consultation and Referendum scheduled for November 16. The statement also presented four demands to the government: the demilitarization of indigenous community territories, the release of those detained during the protests, assistance and reparations for the families of those killed or injured during the strike, and an end to the criminalization and persecution of CONAIE leaders and members.
In response, President Daniel Noboa lifted the State of Emergency under which curfews and restrictions on freedom of assembly had been imposed in the provinces where the protests were concentrated. Despite this announcement, some roadblocks and demonstrations persisted for several days after October 22. Various sectors have expressed concern that these events could set a precedent for the normalization of repression against protests or expressions of dissent, as this marks the first time in several years that a national strike has not concluded with the opening of a dialogue process between the Ecuadorian government and different sectors.
Throughout this period of mobilizations, organizations such as INREDH and Fundamedios condemned the actions of the Ecuadorian State and worked to document instances of violations of civil rights.
&nbsp;
El 22 de octubre de 2025, luego de varias semanas de movilizaciones sociales, el presidente de la Confederación de Nacionalidades Indígenas del Ecuador (CONAIE), Marlon Vargas, anunció el fin del Paro Nacional a través de un comunicado en redes sociales. En el video, insta a las bases de las comunidades indígenas al cese de movilizaciones y despeje de vías, además de impulsar la campaña por la opción “No” en las cuatro preguntas de la Consulta Popular y Referéndum que se llevará a cabo el 16 de noviembre. Este comunicado también expresó cuatro demandas al gobierno: desmilitarizar los territorios de comunidades indígenas, liberar a los detenidos en las manifestaciones, atención y reparación para las familias de víctimas mortales y heridos durante el paro, y el rechazo de la criminalización y persecución a dirigentes y miembros de la CONAIE.
Como respuesta, el presidente Daniel Noboa derogó el Estado de Excepción bajo el que se ordenaron toques de queda y la suspensión de la libertad de reunión en las provincias donde se concentraron las manifestaciones. A pesar de este anuncio, algunos cierres de vías y movilizaciones persistieron por unos días posteriores al 22 de octubre. Desde distintos sectores, existe la preocupación de que estos hechos abran un precedente de normalización de la represión contra manifestaciones o expresiones de disentimiento, pues es la primera vez en varios años que un paro nacional no termina en la apertura de un proceso de diálogo entre el gobierno ecuatoriano y distintos sectores.
A lo largo de este periodo de movilizaciones, organizaciones como INREDH y Fundamedios condenaron las acciones del Estado ecuatoriano y trabajaron en la documentación de instancias de vulneración de derechos civiles.

"Media Censorship on the Rise in the Country","Event Summary
On 14 October 2025, the National Union of Press Workers published a statement on social media warning about instances of censorship across radio networks nationwide. According to their report, these incidents have included threats and even the temporary suspension of journalists and radio programs for covering topics of national interest.
In recent weeks, two events have dominated the country’s news agenda: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to political leader María Corina Machado, and the attack against two Venezuelan activists exiled in Colombia. According to the union’s reports, coverage of these events in various radio programs has led to the temporary suspension of those programs and their hosts.
Although the names of the affected programs or journalists have not been made public, the statement coincides with the temporary removal of two programs aired by stations belonging to one of the country’s most prominent radio networks.
On 10 October 2025, Venezuelan organizations also reported that several journalists and broadcasters were warned by station executives not to report on the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize. They further documented that some radio hosts received verbal warnings from the National Telecommunications Commission (CONATEL).
Preventing coverage of events of international relevance—such as the attack in Colombia involving two Venezuelan human rights defenders and the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize—constitutes a violation of the right to freedom of expression and the right to access information.

"The Venezuelan Government Declares State of Emergency","Event Summary
At the end of September 2025, President Nicolás Maduro announced his intention to declare a state of external commotion—one of the types of states of emergency established in the Venezuelan Constitution. The announcement is linked to growing tensions with the United States due to that country’s military presence in the Caribbean.
This military presence in the Caribbean—which has included attacks on alleged drug-trafficking boats—along with statements made by various U.S. government officials, including President Trump, about the Venezuelan government’s supposed ties to drug trafficking, have heightened tensions between the two countries and worsened the internal climate in Venezuela.
In this context, Vice President Delcy Rodríguez announced that the President had already signed the decree declaring a state of external commotion. However, the contents of the decree remain unknown, and it is unclear whether all constitutional requirements for its entry into force have been met.
States of emergency entail restrictions on certain constitutional rights and guarantees. According to the relevant legal framework, such decrees must be immediately published in the Official Gazette and widely disseminated through the media—neither of which has occurred so far.
Similarly, Venezuelan organizations have warned that this decree declaring a state of external commotion could lead to further militarization of the country and facilitate additional abuses and restrictions on freedoms.
The lack of transparency in the process of implementing and enforcing the decree constitutes a violation of the right to access public information—particularly concerning measures that may restrict constitutional rights.

"Democratic transition in Chile 2025: Presidential and parliamentary elections","Event Summary
In Chile, the final days of the election campaign are underway, which will take place on 16 November 2025, the date on which citizens will elect the future president, senators and deputies.
This context is worth observing for several reasons, including the polarization that can be seen among the candidates and the likelihood of a runoff, since the presidential seat will be awarded to the candidate obtaining more than half of the valid votes cast. On one hand, this reinforces the legitimacy of a democratic process; on the other, it broadens the uncertainty regarding the potential transformations and their implications for the enabling environment for civil society.
In this regard, it is important to note that some candidates have made statements about issues that could considerably affect the enabling environment for civil society. For example, Johannes Kaiser, in a campaign event in southern Chile, mentioned his intentions to withdraw from international treaties and agreements such as the Escazú Agreement, the 2030 Agenda, and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.
In addition, the candidate José Antonio Kast announced, as part of his campaign promises, a reduction of public spending by 6.000 millions pesos within the first 18 months of his government and an estimated 21.000 million pesos. Although he has not specified in which areas would be affected, the proposal has been criticized, as many argue that it would be impossible to implement such a reduction without affecting social benefits—some of which involve the work of civil society organizations.
Finally, over the past month, numerous debates between candidates have taken place, contributing to a more informed election process—at least regarding the central topics discussed in those debates, such as security, the economy, health, education, and migration.

"Ongoing civic space challenges in Gaza and the West Bank","Event Summary
Over the past two years, Israel has launched a full-scale military assault on the Gaza Strip, with reports indicating large-scale displacements, mounting civilian deaths, and spread of famine. In addition, the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry found that Israeli authorities committed four of the five genocidal acts defined under the 1948 Genocide Convention. These developments have disrupted the ability of civil society actors including humanitarian organisations, human rights groups and independent journalists media to operate, communicate with communities, and provide essential assistance.
Although a US-backed ceasefire was announced between Israel and Hamas in early October 2025, it has proven unstable, with ongoing attacks and mutual accusations of violations. The persistent insecurity and destruction have prevented civil society actors and humanitarian agencies from re-establishing operations or restoring communication with affected communities.
In the West Bank, continued Israeli occupation and violence have further constrained the ability of civil society to engage in humanitarian work, advocacy, document violations, and support their constituencies.

"Civil Society Vigil for Peace Dismissed by Government","Event Summary
On 9 November 2025, over 200 people gathered at Woodford Square in Port‑of‑Spain for a public vigil titled “Because Nobody Wins a War,” organised by a coalition of civil society groups including Movement for Social Justice (MSJ) and Emancipation Support Committee. Participants included activists, faith leaders, business representatives and civil society organisations calling for the Caribbean region to remain a “zone of peace” amid escalating military tensions involving the United States and Venezuela.
In response, the country’s Prime Minister, Kamla Persad‑Bissessar, publicly dismissed the event, calling it a “dismal failure” and stating she was “not worried” by the support of the Joint Trade Union Movement (JTUM). She also criticised civil society groups generally, saying the “majority of citizens are fed up with gimmickry and fakery” from groups “that have been in hibernation for the last ten years.”
This development affects key enabling environment principles: civil society is increasingly mobilising on issues beyond its conventional advocacy &#8211; migration, regional security, foreign military presence and peace‑building – thereby widening civic engagement and their role in these non-traditional areas for mobilisation. At the same time, the government’s reaction aiming to delegitimise the mobilization and frame civil society’s role as ineffective signals reduced tolerance for autonomous CSO-led mobilisation and a more adversarial public discourse on civil society. The event serves as a test of how the state reacts to civic mobilisation on strategic issues, and whether CSO space can remain robust in such contexts.

"Attacks on Student Activists Undermine Academic and Civic Freedoms in Zimbabwe","Event Summary
On 10 November 2025, two student union leaders and activists from Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) and members of the Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) were abducted at Mzimba Shopping Centre and later found with severe injuries from beatings. The abduction was carried out by unidentified individuals in a grey Isuzu vehicle without registration plates. Earlier that day, the same vehicle was reportedly seen distributing campaign materials for the Zimbabwe Congress of Students’ Union (ZICOSU), a student movement aligned with the ruling ZANU PF party. Both victims were candidates in the ongoing Student Representative Council (SRC) elections.
This incident highlights escalating threats to freedom of expression, association and political participation within Zimbabwe’s higher education institutions. Under President Emmerson Mnangagwa, state agencies have intensified crackdowns on dissent, with student activists frequently subjected to intimidation, suspension, and violence. Similar incidents have been reported at Midlands State University and Great Zimbabwe University, illustrating a systemic pattern of repression.

On 8 November 2025, President Hakainde Hichilema visited Chingola on the Copperbelt to express condolences and solidarity with victims of the Chiwempala Market fire. During his address, a group of individuals began chanting and throwing stones at the podium, prompting his security detail to evacuate him swiftly. The disturbance, reportedly fueled by frustrations over the closure of illegal mining activities, escalated into a riot involving vandalism and arson. A police vehicle (Toyota Land Cruiser ZP 2537 B) was attacked, its windscreen shattered, overturned, and set ablaze. The presidential holding tent, carpets, a portrait of the President, and other equipment were also destroyed. The Zambia Police Service later confirmed that calm had been restored, investigations launched, and order reestablished in Chingola following the violent incident.

"Government introduces two data protection and governance laws which threaten digital privacy and security","Event Summary
On 9 October 2025, the Government of Bangladesh approved two major data laws as part of a broader digital governance reform agenda: the Personal Data Protection Ordinance and the National Data Governance Ordinance.  The new laws were officially gazetted on 6 November, with the government describing them as key steps toward ensuring data sovereignty, digital resilience, and cyber accountability.
However, civil society groups as well as business leaders have raised concerns that the new laws could be abused by the state and could threaten privacy and innovation. For instance. Transparency International Bangladesh highlighted broad exemptions in subsection 15(4) and Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Ordinance, warning that without judicial oversight the law could become a tool of state control. Daily newspaper Prothom Alo reported that allowing government agencies access to lot of personal data without a court’s permission based on “national security” or “crime prevention”, raise fears of potential misuse. Business leaders also flagged economic risks, with the CEO of Pathao also arguing  that unclear data localisation rules could deter investment and burden startups.
Responding to these criticisms, the Chief Adviser’s Special Assistant for ICT, insisted in an open letter that claims of mandatory data localisation were completely incorrect and based on an outdated draft. He said the government follows a cloud-first policy aligned with international standards. The Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications, and Information Technology said in a press release that the ordinances aims to protect privacy and data security.
However, experts remain concerned that provisions enabling broad state access to personal information and maintaining government control over data governance could lead to misuse.  By expanding state access to personal data without independent oversight, the laws undermine trust, weaken protections for civic actors, and restrict the space for open, secure engagement online.

"Large-scale protests, police repression, and initial reforms reshape enabling environment in Azad Kashmir","Event Summary
The 2025 Azad Kashmir Civil Rights and Economic Justice Protests marked one of the largest public uprisings in Pakistan-administered Kashmir’s recent history. The movement, led by the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) a coalition of traders, lawyers, students, and civil society actors emerged in late September 2025 in response to deepening economic hardship and perceived government neglect. Unlike previous protest that were largely sectoral or economic, this movement expanded into a multi-stakeholder campaign addressing structural governance issues such as legislative reform, accountability, and local control over resources. It drew wider participation across districts and social classes, signaling the growing capacity of civil society networks to organize sustained, cross-regional action. Protesters raised a comprehensive 38-point charter of demands that called for improved public services and the elimination of elite privileges and corruption within the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) administration, among others. They also demanded the abolition of twelve reserved legislative seats for Kashmiri refugees living outside AJK, which they viewed as a political tool of manipulation by federal authorities.
The demonstrations began with strikes and “wheel-jam” shutdowns across major towns including Muzaffarabad, Kotli, Mirpur, and Rawalakot. As participation swelled, the authorities imposed communication blackouts and deployed heavy contingents of security forces to contain the unrest. Tensions escalated sharply when security personnel clashed with demonstrators, using tear gas, baton charges, and live ammunition, resulting in reports of 4-10 casualties on both sides and over a hundred injuries.
Amid mounting public pressure, the federal and AJK governments initiated negotiations with protest leaders. A delegation sent by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s administration engaged with the JKJAAC, eventually leading to an agreement on 4 October 2025 with the government accepting most of the protesters’ demands, including initiating structural governance reforms. Following this commitment, the protest movement agreed to suspend demonstrations and restore normalcy across the region.
The 2025 Azad Kashmir Civil Rights and Economic Justice Protests have significantly reshaped the enabling environment in Pakistan administered Kashmir by exposing deep governance failures, eroding public trust, and simultaneously revitalizing civic mobilization. The movement’s broad-based demands have elevated citizen expectations for accountability and participatory governance, but the state’s harsh response including communication blackouts, arrests, and excessive use of force has narrowed civic space and undermined freedoms of expression and assembly.

"U.S. sanctions on three Palestinian human rights organisations undermine civic space","Event Summary
On 4 September 2025, the United States imposed sanctions on three prominent Palestinian human rights organisations — Al-Mezan Center for Human Rights, the Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR), and Al-Haq: Law in the Service of Man. The decision came as a result of the organisations&#8217; engagements with the International Criminal Court regarding investigations of alleged war crimes by Israel in Gaza.
This move marks a serious escalation in external political pressure on Palestinian civil society, undermining its ability to operate freely, access international funding, and advocate for accountability under international law. The sanctions threaten to weaken the entire enabling environment for human rights and civic engagement, as they may deter other organisations and donors from supporting justice-related work in Palestine.

Civil society actors, including Transparency International Palestine (AMAN), condemned the sanctions as politically motivated and called for their immediate cancellation. Human Rights Watch and other organisations have also urged the U.S. government to immediately rescind the sanctions, highlighting the detrimental impact on humanitarian and human rights work in Gaza and the broader Middle East.

"Historic Pact Coalition holds internal consultation to select candidates","Event Summary
On 26 October 2025, the Historic Pact Coalition in Colombia held an internal consultation to select its left-wing presidential candidate for the May 2026 elections and its legislative candidates for March 2026. Participation exceeded 2,042,978 eligible voters, who chose among several pre-candidates. Iván Cepeda emerged as the winner with 1,477,584 votes (65.15%), defeating his main rival Carolina Corcho, who received 652,008 votes. However, irregularities were reported during the process, including polling stations being removed or not set up, and some voters abandoning the vote after finding stations relocated or closed.
The Historic Pact—a coalition of left-wing parties, social movements, and progressive sectors—called this national consultation to ensure continuity of the current government’s political project while renewing internal leadership after a period of tension among its factions. This process unfolds amid deep political polarization, growing mistrust in electoral institutions, and strong public demand for transparency and meaningful participation in party decisions.

"Thai authorities arrest undocumented Myanmar migrants following postponed ""Pink Card"" registration","Event Summary
On 10 October 2025, the Thai government announced a 15-day grace period (October 15-29) to register undocumented migrant workers from Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, granting them one-year legal work permits, known as the “pink card”. This policy, stemming from an August Cabinet Resolution, aimed to address labour shortages, formalise the status of undocumented migrant workers, and reduce labour exploitation. However, on October 16, the programme was abruptly and indefinitely postponed, citing it was due to the &#8220;current sensitive border situation.&#8221; Concurrently, a severe crackdown began. On the same day as the postponement, Thai authorities arrested 131 Burmese migrant workers in Samut Sakhon who had gathered to register, allegedly after paying brokers over THB 40,000 (approximately USD 1,240) each. Additional arrests followed in Tak and Kanchanaburi provinces between 16 and 19 October, bringing total arrests to around 800 by the end of the month. The migrants who cross the border illegally are subjected to significant financial exploitation, having to pay brokers between THB 20,000 and 24,000 (approximately USD 620-744) for transportation alone. Furthermore, the cost of attempting to obtain legal status is even more extortionate, with some workers reportedly paying up to MMK 8,000,000 (approximately USD 2,190) to cover the broker&#8217;s fees for the promised &#8220;pink card.&#8221; Those detained by Thai authorities face repatriation to Myanmar, where they are at high risk of being forcibly conscripted by the junta. Alarmingly, a recent report indicated that Thai authorities repatriated 1,760 deportees from Thailand&#8217;s Ranong to Myanmar&#8217;s Kawthoung alone, between January and early October 2025, with over 1,700 of these individuals reportedly being forcibly conscripted into military service upon return.

"Opposition leader Fethi Ghares sentenced to two years in prison for allegedly insulting the President","Event Summary
On 21 October 2025, the court of Hussein-Dey (Algiers) sentenced Algerian opposition leader Fethi Ghares to two years in prison, along with a fine of 300,000 dinars (about USD 3200), for allegedly &#8220;insulting the President of the Republic&#8221;, &#8220;insulting a constituted body&#8221; and &#8220;spreading false information likely to undermine public order and security&#8221;. He remains provisionally free pending appeal. According to his lawyers, the case is linked to public statements in which he criticized President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, particularly regarding the announced revision of the electoral law and the law on political parties. He was arrested on 29 September 2025, shortly after these statements, and then prosecuted. This conviction comes after several successive criminal proceedings against him since 2021, including sentences already handed down in 2022, 2024 and 2025 for political remarks, signaling an escalating pattern of judicial harassment. The ruling undermines freedom of expression and association, shrinking civic space and creating a chilling effect on civil society actors who fear reprisals for dissent.

"Stripping Citizenship as a Tool of Repression in Chad: The case of Charfadine Galmaye Saleh (blogger) and N’Guebla Makaïla (activist)","Event Summary
The decision by the Ministry of Administration, Territory and Decentralization in Chad, published on 17 September 2025, to revoke the nationality of Makaila Nguebla, an activist and former human rights adviser to the presidency, as well as journalist Charfadine Galmaye, raises serious concerns about the repression of dissenting voices and respect for human rights in the country. The deprivation of nationality of Makaila Nguebla and Charfadine Galmaye is a major event that reflects the growing tensions between the Chadian government and civil society.
The revocation of nationality from these civil society actors sends a chilling signal to Chadian human rights defenders and activists that criticism of those in power can lead to statelessness—a severe form of reprisal that undermines fundamental rights. This tactic not only strips individuals of legal identity and protection but also fosters an environment of fear and self-censorship within civil society. By weaponizing nationality, authorities effectively silence dissent and weaken advocacy networks, creating long-term risks for democratic space and human rights in Chad. The precedent set by this action could embolden further authoritarian measures, making it critical to monitor and respond swiftly. This underscores the need for continued vigilance regarding human rights and freedom of expression in Chad, while promoting human rights defenders to strengthen their efforts to promote a more just and democratic society.

"Opposition MP Jean Chisenga and 11 Supporters Arrested Amid Alleged Breach of Peace","Event Summary
On 29 October 2025, Mambilima MP Jean Chisenga and 11 others were arrested in Lusaka for alleged conduct likely to cause a breach of peace after a confrontation with police while attempting to hold a political meeting. Authorities claimed the gathering was unsanctioned, while opposition sources described it as routine community engagement. The group was detained at Chelstone Police Station, charged, and later released on bond.
This incident reflects a broader pattern of state actions targeting opposition figures, activists, and civil society since mid-2024. Authorities have increasingly invoked the Public Order Act to restrict political meetings, protests, and mobilization efforts. Opposition rallies have been blocked or dispersed under the guise of maintaining order, while critics—including journalists—face harassment or detention. These measures signal sustained pressure on dissenting voices and a growing intolerance for alternative political expression. The reliance on restrictive laws suggests an entrenched approach to controlling political space through legal and administrative means rather than dialogue, eroding trust in democratic institutions.
The arrests deepen the shrinking civic and political space, creating a chilling effect on community engagement and weakening confidence in law enforcement neutrality. Civil society organizations have condemned the recurring use of vague public order provisions, warning that such actions undermine constitutional rights and risk escalating political polarization. CSOs urge authorities to review the Public Order Act, uphold equal treatment of all political actors, and safeguard civic freedoms ahead of the 2026 elections.

"Technical Committee Launches Provincial Sittings Amid Civil Society Boycott Over Terms of Reference","Event Summary
On 27 October 2025, Zambia’s Technical Committee—mandated to consult citizens and draft constitutional amendments—launched provincial public sittings scheduled to run until 13 November 2025. However, a broad coalition of civil society organizations (CSOs) under the Non-Governmental Gender Organisations’ Coordinating Council (NGOCC) has rejected the Committee’s Terms of Reference, declaring a boycott of submissions and participation. NGOCC argues the process lacks legitimacy and inclusiveness, echoing concerns that it replicates the controversial Bill 7 previously rejected by stakeholders. Opposition figures, including Harry Kalaba, have criticized procedural barriers such as English-only hearings and mandatory written submissions, which exclude non-English speakers and those with limited literacy. Despite these objections, the Technical Committee continues consultations nationwide. Specifically, CSOs have voiced three main concerns. First, the TORs replicate much of the rejected Bill 7, suggesting the process is not genuinely consultative. Second, the short time frame and reliance on provincial sittings hinder broad inclusion. Third, the Committee’s independence and composition do not inspire confidence that divergent public views will be reflected. Many CSOs have demanded the withdrawal or amendment of the ToRs, an extended timeline, decentralized hearings in local languages, and an independent oversight body to guarantee transparency.
These developments signal a shrinking enabling environment for civil society engagement in constitutional reform, raising fears of tokenistic participation and eroded public trust.

"Attacks on civil society ahead of a planned unconstitutional extension of the President's term in Zimbabwe","Event Summary
On 27 October 2025, ten unidentified men attacked the premises of the Southern African Political Economy Series (SAPES) Trust, a regional policy think tank in Harare. After assaulting and abducting the security guard, they locked the gate and set fire to the seminar room and restaurant. Hours later, the guard was released in Harare’s CBD, traumatised and fearing further harm. Just hours later, on 28 October at 1:30 a.m., the home of Gilbert Bgwende, a member of the Constitutional Defence Forum, a civic group opposed to President Mnangagwa’s term extension, was also set ablaze. It was also reported that the police disrupted a press conference in Bulawayo on the same date. These incidents occurred before a critical National Press Conference planned by pro-democracy groups scheduled for 28 October. The conference aimed to address the controversial 2030 Agenda proposed by the ruling ZANU PF party, which seeks to extend the President’s term beyond constitutional limits.
These coordinated attacks—alongside a similar arson at SAPES Trust in 2023—signal a systematic campaign of intimidation targeting civil society and opposition voices. Such actions pose a serious threat to freedom of expression and assembly. In response, civil society organizations have condemned the violence and called for independent investigations, enhanced protection for activists, and international solidarity. They also urge the government to uphold constitutional rights and ensure a safe environment for civic engagement.

"Shrinking Civic Space in Tunisia as Authorities Intensify Crackdown on Associations and Activists","Event Summary
The enabling environment for civil society in Tunisia continued to deteriorate sharply in October 2025. On 9 October, trade unionist Lassaâd Yaâkoubi was arrested under an anti-speculation presidential decree, followed by a committal order the next day. On 21 October, a peaceful march of 40,000 people in Gabès protesting chemical pollution coincided with a UGTT-led general strike; authorities framed the mobilization as politically motivated unrest, and dozens of activists were arrested, and riot police rained tear gas on crowds leading to injury of several demonstrators and riot police.
On 24 October 2025, the president of the Association des Femmes Démocrates (ATFD) reported that authorities suspended their activities for a month over alleged &#8220;infractions&#8221; of the regulations on associations which they have since appealed in court, a move criticised by local CSOs as part of a broader crackdown on civic space under Decree-Law 88. The suspension is seen as a major blow to women’s rights advocacy and democratic freedoms in the country. Detention extensions and trials for civil society figures arrested during the 2024 migration debate crackdown—Mustapha Jammeli, Saloua Grissa, and Chérifa Riahi—signal ongoing judicial pressure.
Meanwhile, rhetoric against foreign funding has intensified, with associations linked to the Open Society Foundation reportedly facing judicial scrutiny and the head of state has used denigrating terms like &#8220;mercenaries&#8221;, &#8220;traitors&#8221; who &#8220;undermine the State in the name of freedom of expression&#8221; referring to CSOs.
Using Decree-Law 88 on associations, Tunisian authorities have issued court orders to dozens of organizations—including the Tunisian Forum for Social and Economic Rights (FTDES) Nawaat and the Tunis branch of the World Organization against Torture (OMCT), ATFD, and Aswat Nissa have suspending their activities for a month for alleged regulatory breaches, a move widely condemned as an assault on civic space. These developments collectively erode freedoms of association, expression, and participation, creating a climate of fear marked by legal harassment, funding restrictions, and operational uncertainty that severely limits civil society’s ability to advocate and deliver services.

"Lesotho Government restricting unions protesting for workers rights","Event Summary
On 31 October 2025, Lesotho’s “Big Six” trade unions held a mass protest to address the severe economic challenges facing the textile industry, the country’s largest private employer. Workers demanded accountability from the government regarding the uncertainty of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) renewal and the lingering impact of punitive US tariffs, which threatened thousands of jobs. The unions also sought redress for long-standing grievances, including unsafe working conditions and the government’s failure to secure severance pay for roughly 1,500 workers abandoned by factories like Ace Apparel.
The police initially denied the permit for the protest planned for October 31, 2025, citing “crucial omissions” in their application. The unions denounced this denial stating that the cited “omissions” are not required by the Public Meetings and Processions Act and called the denial an “administrative obstruction” and the “continued suppression of the right to peaceful assembly and protest”. The march ultimately proceeded, after intervention of the Police Minister granting the permit and under tight police surveillance, with army roadblocks searching all vehicles on major roads leading to the capital city. However, the government response evolved into a form of political victimisation targeting the union coalition.
A letter dated 7 November 2025, from the Prime Minister’s Office Chief of Staff Sofonea Shale, acknowledged the unions’ grievances but sought to introduce division. Shale requested that union leaders indicate whether their union’s grievances should be addressed “under the framework of the march” versus those engaged through “negotiations,” effectively forcing members of the coalition to publicly declare whether they stood with the protest action or opted for dialogue. This was perceived as an attempt to exploit perceived internal differences, an attack on the principle of collective union action, and a move to potentially retaliate against those unions who insisted on continuing the march.
Similar limitations on the  right to peaceful assembly have been observed in Lesotho since the current administration assumed power in October 2022, including a similar denial of protest permit to deliver a petition to the Prime Minister in September 2025. In July 2025, a youth protest was halted when police issued a permit with the wrong date, which organisers denounced as deliberate sabotage and the administrative manipulation of protest procedures.

"Chinese University of Hong Kong cancels playwright Candace Chong's lecture citing inability to provide venue, extending cultural blacklisting to academic institutions","Event Summary
On 26 September 2025, the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) Arts Administrator Office suddenly announced on its website the cancellation of a scheduled October 20, 2025 lecture by renowned playwright Candace Chong Mui-ngam at Shaw Hall, citing that &#8220;the university was unable to provide a venue for this event.&#8221; The lecture, titled &#8220;The Birth of a Drama: From an Idea to Performance,&#8221; had been open for registration to alumni and the public since early September and was free of charge. The cancellation occurred just weeks after Chong publicly revealed on 9 September 2025 that she had been systematically blacklisted by the Hong Kong Arts Development Council, Leisure and Cultural Services Department, and West Kowloon Cultural District Authority. Chong disclosed that her acclaimed play &#8220;We are Gay&#8221; scheduled for November revival at Xiqu Centre&#8217;s Grand Theatre was cancelled, and that she had been explicitly told &#8220;You&#8217;ve been blacklisted. Both shows must stop.&#8221; CUHK responded to media inquiries with a 40-word statement saying only that it &#8220;was unable to provide a venue for this event&#8221; and that &#8220;CUHK&#8217;s current policies and operations for campus facility usage remain normal.&#8221; Notably, another theatre workshop scheduled for October 16 by The Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts (HKAPA) lecturer Fung Ching-ching proceeded without cancellation. Chong responded on Facebook stating Hong Kong&#8217;s management suffers from &#8220;ignorance, mediocrity and cowardice,&#8221; adding &#8220;they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re harming, what they&#8217;re destroying, what they&#8217;re afraid of.&#8221; The CUHK cancellation extends Chong&#8217;s blacklisting from cultural venues to academic institutions, demonstrating comprehensive exclusion from public platforms.

"Algeria Signals Possible End to Death Penalty Moratorium Amid Public Outcry","Event Summary
The president of the Court of Béjaïa, Mustapha Smati, has publicly declared that it will &#8220;soon return to the application of the death penalty&#8220;, suspended since 1993, in certain cases considered particularly serious: child abduction and drug trafficking in schools. These words were widely reported by the Algerian press and social networks and were presented by many as an announcement of an imminent resumption of capital executions in Algeria. The magistrate justified this prospect by indicating that it would meet the commitments of President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, in connection with his opening speech of the 2025-2026 judicial year. The judicial authorities also insist on a context of strong public emotion after cases of kidnapping and murder of children, as well as on the concern related to the circulation of drugs in schools. Faced with the shock caused by these statements, a government source indicated that it is not yet an enforceable decision, but an &#8220;orientation&#8221; or an internal reflection on the possible lifting of the moratorium that has blocked executions since 1993.

"Pro-Palestinian activists march in Hong Kong marking two years of Gaza war, a rare public demonstration","Event Summary
On 8 October 2025, five Hong Kong activists marched in Tsim Sha Tsui to condemn Israel&#8217;s war on Gaza and call for a ceasefire, marking two years since the conflict began. The protesters began at the Kowloon Mosque and marched along Nathan Road before arriving at the harbourfront, waving Palestinian flags and placards labeling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a &#8220;genocidal war criminal&#8221; and calling for the &#8220;abolition of the Zionist state.&#8221; They chanted slogans including &#8220;Stop the genocide,&#8221; &#8220;Free, free Palestine,&#8221; and &#8220;From Ukraine to Palestine, occupation is a crime.&#8221; Among the participants was activist Yu Wai-pan, a former member of the now-defunct League of Social Democrats which disbanded in June 2025 after 19 years. About 10 minutes after protesters arrived at Tsim Sha Tsui ferry pier, several police officers arrived and photographed the protesters, checked identity documents including an Egyptian passport of a man who joined during a stopover at Chungking Mansions. An HKFP reporter was stopped and asked to hand over their press pass and Hong Kong ID card for identity checks, with police questioning how they knew about the demonstration. About a dozen officers then followed the protesters as they marched back to the MTR station. This demonstration represents a rare instance of public protest in Hong Kong&#8217;s current restrictive environment, demonstrating that some forms of international solidarity activism remain possible despite general constraints on public assembly and expression.

"Continued Enforcement of Israeli Restrictions Limits Humanitarian and Civil Society Operations in the oPt","Event Summary
Continued Enforcement of Israeli Restrictions Limits Humanitarian and Civil Society Operations in the oPt
The Israeli occupation authorities continue to enforce restrictive procedures for registering international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) operating in the Palestinian territories. These measures, first announced in March 2025, are seen as an attempt to silence independent humanitarian voices and restrict their vital operations.
On 13 August 2025, more than 100 international and local humanitarian organizations operating in the occupied Palestinian territory  voiced alarm over the continued enforcement of Israeli procedures regulating the registration and operation of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs). The rules, introduced earlier in 2025, have been described as an extension of Israel’s policy to control humanitarian access and restrict the civic space of independent organizations.
The procedures require INGOs to submit detailed lists of Palestinian staff and funding sources for security clearance, a measure that many groups have rejected due to serious concerns over staff safety, data privacy, and potential misuse of information. The implementation of these restrictions has significantly delayed or blocked the entry of essential humanitarian supplies into the Gaza Strip, worsening an already catastrophic situation for civilians.
Humanitarian agencies, including Oxfam, CARE, and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), warned that Israel’s policies are effectively “weaponising aid” by turning bureaucratic requirements into tools of political control. They stressed that the measures undermine neutral humanitarian principles and endanger both aid workers and beneficiaries.
The humanitarian toll remains unprecedented, According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), at least 565 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since October 2023. The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) also reports that over 370 of its staff members have been killed as of October 2025.
The continued enforcement of these measures highlights growing concerns over Israel’s control of humanitarian operations in the oPt and raises urgent questions about accountability, access, and the protection of humanitarian workers under international law.

"Public order alert following clashes in Puerto Rondón, Arauca","Event Summary
On 24 October 2025, Colombia’s Ombudsman’s Office warned of a serious public order crisis in Puerto Rondón, Arauca, due to active clashes between the FARC-EP dissident fronts (10th, 28th, and 45th) and the ELN’s Eastern War Front. Fighting has directly affected civilians: at least 35 families in El Perocero face restricted mobility and fear, while 29 families in El Ripial and Maporal risk confinement. These hostilities violate international humanitarian law by exposing non-combatants to crossfire and displacement. Authorities have been urged to coordinate urgent protection, deterrence, and humanitarian assistance. The escalation threatens the enabling environment for civil society by increasing insecurity, limiting freedom of movement, and diverting state resources away from social programs toward conflict response—further shrinking civic space in a region already marked by violence and weak institutional presence. In addition to endangering lives, this escalation also erodes the enabling environment for civic engagement and service delivery, deepening vulnerability in an already fragile context.

"Blockades and protests in southwestern Colombia by ethnic communities","Event Summary
From 14 to 17 October 2025, roadblocks and demonstrations took place on the Cali-Buenaventura road, organised by ethnic and peasant communities expressing their dissatisfaction with the national government&#8217;s failure to comply with agreements on land and social investment. This route is one of the most important for Colombia, as it connects the port of Buenaventura with the rest of the country. As a result, the impact of these blockades exceeded 30 billion Colombian pesos (about 8 million dollars) and left several surrounding areas with food and gas shortages. The incident left four police officers injured and involved the use of force by the Valle del Cauca provincial government.
The leadership of this mobilisation is attributed to the so-called Congreso de los Pueblos (People&#8217;s Congress), a national organisation that includes peasants, indigenous peoples, Afro-Colombian communities, among others. This is a pattern of demonstrations where roads have been blocked on repeated occasions throughout 2025 to pressure dialogue between communities and the national government.
The demonstration came to an end when the community that was holding the protest reached an agreement with a delegation from the national government. The agreement includes commitments by the national government on issues related to agrarian reform, the dismantling of paramilitarism, and mining and environmental policies.

"Repeated suspensions and regulatory harassment of media outlets","Event Summary
Since January 2025, Benin’s High Authority for Audiovisual and Communication (HAAC) has multiplied decisions to withdraw authorisations, frequencies, and slots on the digital multiplex, targeting several audiovisual media outlets. The decisions taken in November 2025 follow this same trend, with the simultaneous withdrawal of frequencies for Mifon FM, Couffo FM, Aïfa FM, Urban FM and Nostalgie FM, as well as the removal of multiplex slots for Canal 2 Star, Imalè Africa TV and Tunde Agric TV. In each case, the HAAC cites non-compliance with regulatory requirements, particularly the obligation of regular broadcasting established in Article 5.
Although these decisions are based on legitimate legal grounds and on the need to ensure the proper management of the radio spectrum, their accumulation over a short period — starting as early as the beginning of 2025 — raises major concerns about their overall impact on press freedom, media pluralism, and the public’s access to diverse information. Indeed, the repeated use of the most severe sanction (the outright withdrawal of authorisation) reduces the number of media actors operating, increases the sector’s vulnerability, and may have a chilling effect on the newsrooms that remain active.
The lack of public information on whether the economic, technical, or structural difficulties of the affected media were examined also limits the transparency of the process. A thorough assessment appears necessary to determine whether this succession of decisions, while legally compliant, remains proportionate and compatible with constitutional guarantees on freedom of expression and freedom of the press.

"Contested constitutional reforms","Event Summary
On 14 November 2025, the Parliament adopted Law No. 2025-20, amending the Constitution (Law No. 90-32 of 11 December 1990, as revised by Law No. 2019-40 of 7 November 2019), by 90 votes in favor and 19 against. The reform introduces significant constitutional changes and raises serious concerns regarding its democratic legitimacy. This development comes less than six months before Benin’s general elections, including the presidential, legislative, and local elections.
Notably, the reform follows the exclusion of all opposition parties from the upcoming elections. The presidential ticket of the party LES DÉMOCRATES, along with all of its municipal election candidate lists, were barred by the National Electoral Commission (CENA), a decision subsequently upheld by both the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court.
Key provisions of the reform include:


Presidential term: extended from 5 to 7 years, renewable only once.


Bicameral Parliament: consisting of the National Assembly and a newly established Senate.


Parliamentary term: extended to 7 years, with mechanisms intended to prevent political party switching.


These reforms, however, have been widely perceived as a consolidation of power. They were enacted without national consensus, public mobilization, or meaningful consultation with civil society. When combined with the prior exclusion of political opposition, these factors raise serious doubts about the legitimacy, fairness, and democratic acceptability of the constitutional amendments.

"Congress  eliminates the Commission on Indigenous and Afro-Peruvian Peoples during the transition toward the Bicameral Congress of 2026","Event Summary
On 23 October 2025, the Congress of the Republic of Peru approved the regulations governing the new bicameral Congress for 2026, which will eliminate the current Commission on Andean, Amazonian, and Afro-Peruvian Peoples, Environment and Ecology &#8211;  and replace it with a new Commission on Environment and Sustainability. The eliminated Commission is a congressional committee that has provided an important platform for engagement with indigenous groups in Peru. As such, this decision represents a serious setback for the protection of Indigenous and Afro-Peruvian rights, the environment, and the guarantee of their representation in political participation.
The Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest (AIDESEP) issued a statement rejecting this measure, noting that it represents an “institutional, political, democratic, and historical setback for Indigenous peoples”. Furthermore, they stated that establishment of the new Commission in practice “means the disappearance of the only specialized parliamentary body that provides a technical, differentiated, and intercultural approach to the problems faced by Indigenous peoples”. A constitutional lawyer at the Legal Defense Institute also stated that this measure represents a setback in terms of prior consultation, highlighting that there must have been consultations before taking this measure that directly affects Indigenous peoples.  On the other hand, the congressmen who support the measure argued that it is based on the need establish a budget cap for the functioning of the upcoming chambers.
This measure signals a progressive deterioration of the enabling environment for citizen participation by further reducing the already limited spaces for dialogue and oversight between the government and indigenous communities. Its elimination would affect not only their ability to influence the formulation of public policies that affect them, but also the response to their social and environmental demands and their capacity to defend their collective rights.

"Arrest of Kenyan activists in Uganda signals intensifying crackdown on opposition","Event Summary
In the lead-up to Uganda’s January 2026 general elections, where President Yoweri Museveni is seeking a seventh term, Ugandan security forces have intensified crackdowns on opposition figures and their associates. A notable incident involved the abduction and secret detention of two Kenyan human rights activists, Bob Njagi and Nicholas Oyoo, who were in Uganda to support opposition leader Robert Kyagulanyi (Bobi Wine) of the National Unity Platform (NUP). News outlets reported seeing them forced into a car by masked men in uniforms after attending a political event.
This event highlights broader patterns of transnational political repression in East Africa, including similar abductions in Tanzania earlier in 2025, amid rising concerns over democratic backsliding ahead of elections in Uganda in January 2026, and Kenya in 2027, and the region’s recent polls in Tanzania in October 2025. The activists were held incommunicado for 38 days without formal charges or court appearances and were detained in Uganda’s notorious “fridge” military cells where they endured torture before their release on November 8 amid diplomatic pressure.  The incident mirrors past disappearances of opposition supporters across the region and is intertwined with a surge in domestic arrests of National Unity Platform supporters, with at least 500 arrested since November 2024. Fears of escalating pre-election violence have further been intensified by a major crackdown in Mbarara on November 7, where over 60 NUP supporters were arrested, beaten, and held incommunicado under brutal conditions. The Mbarara incident, occurring just days after Museveni’s comments about holding Kenyan activists in a fridge, exemplifies the regime’s strategy to dismantle opposition voices and dissent through mass detentions, beatings, and fabricated charges.
These events have severely degraded Uganda’s enabling environment for civil society by instilling fear among human rights defenders and activists, forcing self-censorship and trauma that leaves activists withdrawn from activism. CSOs that provide legal aid had to divert resources to emergency legal aid amid lawyer harassment. The events also disrupt key CSO activities like voter education, risking a silent democratic collapse ahead of the January 2026 elections.

"Destabilization charges filed against 97 individuals involved in September 21 protests","Event Summary
On 28 October 2025, the Philippine National Police’s Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) filed charges against 97 individuals, accusing them of being &#8220;instigators and financiers&#8221; of rebellion, sedition, and inciting sedition. These charges relate to violent incidents during the anti-corruption protests on 21 September 2025 in Mendiola, Manila. Six individuals, including student leaders, a vlogger, and a former parliamentarian, confirm having received subpoenas but deny the allegations. The PNP plans to file charges against at least 40 more people in the future.
The protests were part of a national movement demanding government accountability, especially regarding the Trillion Peso flood control scandal in the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). The protests coincided with the 53rd anniversary of the Declaration of Martial Law under Ferdinand Marcos Sr., father of sitting president Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr. Violent clashes occurred, with at least 216 protesters detained, including 103 minors. The protests were marked by police brutality including use of excessive force such as gunfire, tear gas, and brute force. Despite the documentation of these events by mainstream and social media, government officials, including Secretary Jonvic Remulla, downplayed the violence, claiming the government exercised &#8220;maximum tolerance&#8221; and that no one was hurt.
The criminalization of activists, including the 97 charged individuals, is seen as part of a broader effort by the government to control public discourse by denying its accountability for violence while misdirecting public attention to criminalize dissent and activism. The controversy has also deepened ideological rifts within the activist community, with one of the largest protest organizers, 1Sambayan, distancing themselves from Makabayan (Nationalist) groups to avoid association with government opposition. The situation also contributes to the culture of &#8220;red-tagging&#8221; and political repression, particularly targeting student and youth leaders.
The government&#8217;s response to the protests and subsequent criminal charges thus highlight concerns about a deteriorating enabling environment, including the suppression of dissent, the denial of state violence, and reinforces ideological divisions within civil society

"Education Ministry orders removal of ""gender"" from all education materials","Event Summary
The Ministry of Education and Science (MEC) of Paraguay issued Resolution No. 1803 on November 7, 2025, mandating the removal of the word &#8220;gender&#8221; from all educational materials, both printed and digital. This extends a previous resolution (No. 29664 from 2017) that banned the use of gender theory and ideology in schools. Social organizations, such as FEIPAR, have strongly criticized this new resolution, arguing that it violates constitutional principles of equality, freedom, and pluralism, and represents a setback for human rights and civic education.
Critics argue that limiting the discussion to &#8220;equality between men and women&#8221; neglects the broader social power dynamics and the formation of gender stereotypes, leading to the inequalities experienced by women and girls in Paraguayan society. Teachers&#8217; unions have voiced concerns that this move signals a regression in educational policy and democracy, with some suggesting religious groups, particularly evangelical sectors, are influencing the decision. Pro-life groups have celebrated the resolution, claiming it protects children.
The decision aligns with a broader trend of excluding the term &#8220;gender&#8221; from public policy, reflecting the government&#8217;s stance that the gender approach, what they term &#8220;gender ideology,&#8221; undermines national sovereignty and promotes anti-rights positions. The exclusion of the word &#8220;gender&#8221; contradicts its use in Paraguay&#8217;s National Development Plan 2030, as well as in various public bodies and programs, such as the Gender Secretariat of the Supreme Court and the &#8220;Equality Action Plan&#8221; under the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development.
Overall, this move highlights the ongoing struggle in Paraguay over gender rights, with the government continuing to prioritize binary gender recognition and downplay gender diversity. Part of this trend is the proposal to replace the Ministry of Women with the Ministry of the Family. It perpetuates anti-NGO narratives claiming that the so-called &#8220;gender ideology&#8221; constitutes a &#8220;loss of sovereignty&#8221; or &#8220;foreignization promoted by NGOs/CSOs&#8221; and signals further regression of gender equality, expected to affect also equal participation in civic life.

"Sierra Leone Police cancel procession against synthetic drug ‘Kush’","Event Summary
On 16 November 2025, organizers of the planned Black Friday “Stop Kush na Salone” procession—aimed at protesting the growing Kush drug crisis in Freetown, Sierra Leone—announced the event’s cancellation after the Sierra Leone Police (SLP) formally refused to grant clearance. The SLP issued a letter citing Section 17 of the 1965 Public Order Act, despite Section 26 of the 1991 Constitution guaranteeing citizens’ freedom of assembly.
One organizer reported being threatened with arrest by senior police officials if the march proceeded. This decision reflects a recurring pattern where the SLP blocks public protests under the guise of “public interest,” undermining constitutional rights. Such actions create a restrictive environment for civic activism, discourage citizen participation, erode trust in state institutions, and limit CSOs’ ability to advocate for social issues—ultimately shrinking civic space in Sierra Leone.

"Draft Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Bill signals further militarization of digital space","Event Summary
The Indonesian Law Ministry has finalized the draft Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Bill (RUU KKS) as of 1 October 2025, and submitted it to the House of Representatives for prioritization in the 2026 legislative agenda. This bill responds to increasing cyberattacks and aims to establish a comprehensive framework for managing cyber threats, including regulations for digital product providers, guidelines on artificial intelligence ethics, and procedures for responding to cyber incidents. However, it emphasizes state-centric national security over individual digital rights, introduces concepts like “digital treason” with penalties of up to 20 years’ imprisonment for attacks threatening sovereignty, and controversially assigns investigative roles to the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI). Critics argue this fosters legal ambiguities, overlaps with existing laws such as the Electronic Information and Transactions Law, and conflates cybersecurity with cybercrime enforcement, potentially eroding civilian oversight and democratic norms. The draft builds on prior versions from 2019 and early 2024 but retains these structural flaws, prompting calls for revisions to prioritize human-centric protections.
The bill continues the militarization in Indonesia’s cybersecurity domain as part of a broader trend of expansion of military reach in civilian areas of governance. Since late 2024, the government has progressively integrated TNI into cyber operations, beginning with the creation of a dedicated military cyber force in November 2024 following a high-profile data breach at the TNI’s Strategic Intelligence Agency. This was reinforced by the TNI Law revision in early 2025, which expanded non-war military roles to include cyber threat management without clear threat-grading criteria, potentially justifying TNI probes into non-state threats like journalistic leaks. Similar concerns arose in October 2025 when civil society groups, including Kontras, highlighted 85 TNI-related violence cases in the prior year, warning that cyber bill provisions could enable broader crackdowns on dissent.
If enacted without revisions, the RUU KKS poses significant long-term threats to Indonesia’s enabling environment by accelerating the militarization of cyberspace, potentially entrenching authoritarian tendencies and weakening democratic safeguards. Key actors affected include citizens, whose digital rights—such as privacy and freedom of expression—are often sidelined in favor of state interests, potentially exposing them to disproportionate penalties, which could deter online activism.

"Council of State Orders President Petro and Interior Benedetti to Retract Accusations Against Ocaña Official","Event Summary
On 18 November 2025, the Council of State ruled that President Gustavo Petro and Interior Minister Armando Benedetti must retract public statements accusing Jorge Armando Bohórquez, the representative of Ocaña (Norte de Santander), of alleged links to the ELN. The decision responds to a tutela filed in July 2025, after Bohórquez sought protection due to threats against his life and family following these accusations.
This ruling carries broader implications. President Petro has previously made similar accusations, such as referring to journalists as “mafia dolls,” a case in which the Constitutional Court also ordered a retraction. Such statements from the head of state contribute to harmful narratives that stigmatize human rights defenders—like the personero—and distort reality by associating political opponents with armed groups, undermining their legitimacy in public discourse.
By requiring a retraction, the Council of State helps restore the reputation of those committed to defending communities and promotes a healthier democratic environment. Accusations without evidence erode trust in institutions, foster stigmatization of local officials, and weaken dialogue between civil society and government authorities. This ruling reinforces that even the highest offices of the State must exercise responsibility in public statements, thereby strengthening accountability and improving the enabling environment for human rights work.

"Protests, Police Crackdown, and Internet Shutdown Mark Samia’s Re-election in Tanzania","Event Summary
On 29 October 2025, Tanzania held its General Election to choose the President, Members of Parliament, and Councilors. The vote effectively marked the re-election of President Samia Suluhu Hassan for her second and final term under the Sixth Phase Government.
Polling stations opened at 7:00 a.m. as scheduled, with several top government officials and candidates casting their ballots early and praising the National Electoral Commission for its organization. However, the calm atmosphere shifted dramatically mid-morning when videos circulated online showing protests breaking out in Ubungo, Dar es Salaam. Police were seen firing tear gas to disperse demonstrators.
The protests quickly spread to other parts of the city, including Sinza, Tandale, Mwananyamala, Kimara, and Kibamba. By midday, reports of unrest had emerged from other regions, such as Songwe, Mwanza, Mara, and Mbeya, where police were accused of using excessive force to quell the demonstrations.
In an attempt to contain the situation, the government ordered a nationwide internet shutdown, citing security concerns. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, Mahmoud Thabit Kombo, said the measure was necessary because “small groups of vandals were using the internet to incite chaos and destruction.”
The shutdown lasted from around noon on October 29 until 4:00 p.m. on November 3, 2025. Connectivity was restored after President Samia’s swearing-in ceremony for her second term, when she directed that “all services should return to normal.”
The move, however, drew criticism from human rights groups and opposition figures who argued that the shutdown violated citizens’ rights to access information and further deepened concerns over the credibility of an election already marred by arrests of opposition leaders and allegations of repression.

"YouTube removes hundreds of videos from Palestinian organisations documenting Israeli human rights violations","Event Summary
In October 2025, more than 700 videos documenting alleged Israeli violations of international humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territory were permanently removed from the video-sharing platform YouTube. The deleted content included testimonies and investigations into the killing of Palestinian journalists, and visual evidence of home demolitions and forced displacement in the West Bank. Over the years, these organisations had built extensive digital archives containing verified footage that served as crucial documentation of human rights abuses and evidence for international accountability mechanisms.
The content removal was due to complete deletion of the official YouTube accounts of three major Palestinian human rights organizations — Al-Haq, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR). Youtube reportedly confirmed that the deletion was as a direct result of United States’ sanctions against the organisations for their engagements with the International Criminal Court regarding investigations of alleged war crimes by Israel in Gaza.
This  has raised serious concerns among digital rights advocates, who argue that removing such archives represents a direct assault on transparency, accountability, and freedom of information. The Palestinian Center for Human Rights reportedly have criticised YouTube’s actions stating it “protects perpetrators from accountability”. The deletion occurred amid ongoing restrictions imposed by Israeli authorities on civil society operations, humanitarian access, and independent documentation.

"Supreme Court Verdict on Summoning of Lawyers by Investigating Officers in Criminal Cases","Event Summary
On 31 October 2025, the Supreme Court of India delivered a landmark verdict explicitly limiting the powers of investigating agencies to summon lawyers for questioning in ongoing criminal investigations without prior approval. The bench, led by Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran, declared that lawyers cannot be compelled to divulge confidential communications with clients except in exceptional cases, and such exceptional cases must be clearly outlined and approved in writing by a superior officer not below the rank of Superintendent of Police. The verdict responds to growing concerns over arbitrary summons to legal professionals, which threaten lawyer-client privilege and the right to a fair trial. Further, the judgment clarified procedures for the production of digital devices and documents, ensuring judicial oversight and safeguarding the confidentiality of unrelated client information. In-house counsel, as opposed to independent advocates, are not covered under the same privilege, but are still protected under relevant sections for legal advisors. The Supreme Court’s directions set aside a specific summons issued to a Gujarat-based advocate, marking a significant step to fortify legal protections for members of the bar across India.

"Escalating Abductions and Political Arrests Raise Alarm in Tanzania","Event Summary
Between 6 October and 24 October 2025, Tanzania witnessed a series of alarming incidents involving prominent political figures and unexplained acts of violence.
On 6 October, former Tanzanian Ambassador to Cuba, Humphrey Polepole, was reportedly abducted and remains missing to date. Despite his high profile — having previously served as High Commissioner to Malawi, CCM’s Ideology and Publicity Secretary, and a Member of Parliament — authorities have not issued any official statement or condemnation regarding his disappearance.
Ten days later, on 16 October, the bodies of four unidentified young men, aged between 19 and 22, were discovered along the Mapinga–Kibaha roadside in the Coast Region. The victims, believed to be residents of Dar es Salaam, bore severe injuries on their faces and legs, raising fears of extrajudicial killings.
Then, on 22 October, John Heche, the CHADEMA Vice Chairman (Mainland), was arrested outside the High Court in Dar es Salaam while attending hearings related to key party cases. His arrest, captured on video and widely shared, sparked national concern after his whereabouts remained unknown for two days.
By 24 October, CHADEMA confirmed that Heche was being held at Mtumba Police Station in Dodoma, though the police have yet to issue any official statement on the matter.
Collectively, these events have deepened public unease over the state of political freedom, human rights, and accountability in Tanzania, as silence from the authorities continues to fuel speculation, fear and uncertainty, signaling a high-risk environment for civic engagement, opposition activity, and human rights advocacy. These developments undermine democratic norms, erode trust in state institutions, and create significant operational and security challenges for civil society organizations and activists.

"Zimbabwe Increases Civil Society Engagement in the APRM Meeting","Event Summary




On 4 November 2025, the Government of Zimbabwe convened an African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) review meeting with civil society in Harare, reaffirming its commitment to governance reforms and regional integration. The APRM, an African Union initiative, provides a platform for dialogue on governance and socio-economic indicators, engaging government institutions, CSOs, private sector, and media. This review was notable for the inclusion of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), signaling potential openness to collaboration. CSOs assessed Zimbabwe’s progress on issues such as women’s rights, anti-corruption measures, and engagement with state institutions. Ambassador Albert Ranganai Chimbindi, APRM Focal Point, emphasized the government’s willingness to engage but urged CSOs to use existing channels rather than seeking high-level access, which he argued yields limited results.





Despite positive engagement, procedural shortcomings emerged: late invitations, outdated mailing lists, and missed communication prevented some CSOs from participating. These gaps raise concerns about inclusivity and coordination in future processes. While the meeting suggests a step toward constructive dialogue, the effectiveness of such engagement remains uncertain. If coordination improves, this could strengthen civic space and accountability.

"Harare Magistrate Refuses to Release Journalist’s Travel Documents as Crackdown on Dissent Deepens in Zimbabwe","Event Summary
On 28 October 2025, a Harare court has denied journalist Faith Zaba’s application of alteration of bail conditions, to enable her access to her passport to travel for international media leadership events, raising alarm over judicial overreach and shrinking freedom of expression, assembly and association. The ruling, delivered by Magistrate Tapiwa Kuhudzai, prevents Zaba—editor of the Zimbabwe Independent—from attending the Women in News Guild Gathering and Asia Media Leaders’ Summit in Singapore, where she was invited as one of 19 global women leaders. The State opposed her request, citing flight risk concerns, and the magistrate ruled that permitting travel was “not in the interest of justice.” Rights advocates argue this decision infringes on Zaba’s constitutional rights to freedom of movement and professional development, signaling judicial complicity in restricting civic space. The ruling undermines Zimbabwe’s commitment to gender equality and media freedom, creating a chilling effect on journalists’ participation in global platforms. As noted by Amnesty International, Zaba’s case highlights a pressing need for reform in Zimbabwe&#8217;s legislative landscape to safeguard freedom of expression. This comes amid a growing list of activists, journalists, and dissenting voices under siege in Zimbabwe, reinforcing fears of an increasingly hostile environment for civil society. Laws such as the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [Chapter 9:23] and the Cyber and Data Protection Act [Chapter 12:07] have been increasingly weaponised against journalists, framing critical reporting as criminal activity.
Zaba’s legal ordeal began on 1 July 2025, when she was charged with “undermining or insulting the authority of the President” after publishing a satirical column titled When We Become a Mafia State on 27 June. Authorities claimed her commentary fostered hostility toward President Mnangagwa’s administration. The case drew condemnation from the Committee to Protect Journalists, which warned it reflects state fragility and misuse of resources to silence dissent. This court ruling deepens the erosion of an enabling environment for civil society, reinforcing patterns of judicial overreach and state intolerance of critical voices.

"15-Year Sentence to Union Leader in Escalating Crackdown and use of Anti-terrorism Laws against Dissent","Event Summary
On 29 October 2025, the criminal court of first instance in Oum El Bouaghi sentenced president of National Union of Culture and Art Officials (SNFC) and critical human rights defender Ali Mammeri to 15 years in prison on charges of &#8220;glorifying terrorism&#8221; and &#8220;disseminating classified information via electronic means of communication.&#8221; According to Amnesty International, the allegations include private communications with exiled activists and information about retaliatory measures targeting unions, which were later shared in discussions before ILO supervisory bodies. Mammeri also reported ill-treatment in custody, including beatings, forced stripping, and the use of coerced confessions—despite the obligation to investigate such claims. He has filed an appeal. Several organizations (Amnesty International, SHOAA, COSYFOP) argue that this ruling exemplifies the abusive use of anti-terrorism laws to crush peaceful dissent and obstruct independent union activity. The case occurs against a backdrop of broader restrictions targeting human rights defenders and trade unions in Algeria, marking a significant deterioration in the enabling environment for civil society and independent unions.

"Boualem Sansal Pardoned After Year in Detention Amid Diplomatic Pressure and Ongoing Crackdown on Dissent in Algeria","Event Summary
On 12 November 2025, Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune pardoned Franco-Algerian writer Boualem Sansal, who had been detained since November 2024 and sentenced on 27 March 2025 to five years in prison for “undermining state security” and “national unity.” The Algerian presidency stated the pardon followed a humanitarian appeal by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, citing Sansal’s advanced age (81) and poor health. Under the agreement, Germany will cover his transfer and medical care. Sansal was released, moved to Berlin, and later traveled to France. Indeed, this positive outcome is worth recognition as it slightly reduces the number of jailed activists and offers a precedent for international engagement.
This case unfolds amid heightened diplomatic tensions between Algeria, France, and the European Union, fueled by historical disputes and disagreements over Western Sahara. While the pardon offers a humanitarian and diplomatic resolution, it does not alter the restrictive legal framework that enabled Sansal’s conviction. The episode underscores the vulnerability of writers and activists under broad security laws and signals persistent risks to freedom of expression. Such selective clemency—dependent on international intervention—raises concerns about unequal protections and deepens uncertainty for civil society actors, eroding trust in domestic legal safeguards and reinforcing a climate of repression. In addition, it is critical to emphasize that this remains an isolated case amid a broader pattern of repression. The enabling environment for civil society continues to deteriorate, with systemic misuse of security laws and escalating restrictions on fundamental freedoms.

"Weaponization of Anti-Terror Laws Intensifies in Algeria as Hirak Poet’s Five-Year Sentence Sparks Global Outcry Ahead of New Trial","Event Summary
On 11 November 2025, activist and poet Mohamed Tadjadit was sentenced to five years in prison on terrorism-related charges, including “condoning terrorism” and “supporting terrorist organizations.” His lawyer confirmed the conviction, which carries grave implications for freedom of expression in Algeria. This ruling comes ahead of a new trial scheduled for 30 November, where Tadjadit and 12 other activists face additional state security charges punishable by long-term imprisonment and even the death penalty—despite the allegations being based solely on peaceful activism and private online communications advocating political reform.
Just a day earlier, on 10 November, twenty Algerian, regional, and international organizations, including the Foundation for the Promotion of Rights, had urged authorities to drop all charges and release Tadjadit and his co-defendants. Their joint statement condemned the prosecutions as baseless and warned that the misuse of anti-terrorism laws against protected expression creates a chilling effect, eroding fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.
Tadjadit, known as “the poet of the Hirak” for his role in Algeria’s 2019 pro-democracy protests, has faced relentless judicial harassment since 2019, including multiple imprisonments, a pardon in November 2024, and re-arrest in January 2025. His latest conviction signals escalating repression, threatening the enabling environment for civil society and discouraging activism across the country.

"UPND Cadres Attack PF Party Secretariat in Lusaka","Event Summary
On 15 November 2025, individuals wearing United Party for National Development (UPND) party regalia allegedly attacked the Patriotic Front (PF) Secretariat in Lusaka, forcefully entering the building and damaging property. The UPND, the ruling party in Zambia, and the Patriotic Front (PF), the main opposition party and former ruling party, have been at the centre of heightened political tensions across the country. Videos circulating online captured the incident, prompting PF to report the matter to Lusaka Central Police and accuse ruling-party cadres of politically motivated aggression. In response, the UPND publicly condemned the attack and urged citizens and party supporters to desist from violence, stressing that its leadership did not sanction such actions. The Human Rights Commission (HRC) also issued a statement condemning the incident and calling for thorough investigations to ensure accountability. This episode underscores growing political polarization and raises concerns about the potential erosion of democratic norms and civic space in Zambia, as violence and intimidation threaten peaceful political engagement.

"Algeria Halts Cruel Stray Animal Killing Campaigns After Civil Society Pressure","Event Summary
On 15 November 2025, the Algerian Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries issued a landmark instruction to all walis, ordering the immediate and permanent halt of stray animal killing campaigns across municipalities. The directive bans shooting, poisoning, and beating—previously described as “savage and disorderly”—and mandates humane alternatives such as rabies vaccination, sterilization, and temporary shelters, in line with international standards. This policy shift follows weeks of intense advocacy by civil society actors, including veterinarians, animal protection associations, and citizens. Mobilization efforts ranged from petitions and digital campaigns (#StopGaloufaEnAlgérie) to free vaccination drives and direct engagement with the Minister, demanding humane solutions like TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) and shelter creation. While the ministry does not officially credit these actions, it acknowledges a “broad debate within civil society” and criticism from international organizations—clear evidence that structured citizen pressure influenced this decision.  This move marks a significant improvement in Algeria’s approach to animal welfare and demonstrates the power of coordinated civil society advocacy to drive policy change, reinforcing the enabling environment for civic engagement.

"Arbitrary Arrest and Torture of Humanitarian Activist and Photographer Nader Minallah Mahmoud","Event Summary
On 4 October 2025, humanitarian activist and photographer Nader Minallah Mahmoud was arbitrarily arrested in Damazin, the capital of Sudan’s Blue Nile State, without any legal basis. His detention followed a grueling two-day journey to Wad al-Mahi, after which he was hospitalized for severe exhaustion. Shortly after recovering, Nader voluntarily responded to a summons from the “Security Cell,” a joint force comprising the army, police, and intelligence services. Despite his compliance, authorities have not disclosed formal charges, the legal grounds for his arrest, or his place of detention, raising serious concerns for his safety.
This incident illustrates a dangerous escalation in Sudan’s systematic crackdown on civil and humanitarian work. Targeting a prominent humanitarian figure signals a deliberate strategy to silence independent voices and restrict civic space. The lack of transparency and due process not only violates individual rights but also undermines trust in state institutions, creating a climate of fear for activists and humanitarian workers. Such actions threaten the enabling environment for civil society, discouraging engagement and weakening efforts to deliver aid and advocate for human rights in a context already marked by conflict and instability.

"SpaceX Crackdown on Scam Centers in Myanmar Cuts Vital Communication Lifelines for Civil Society and Conflict-Affected Communities","Event Summary
On 22 October 2025, SpaceX announced it had cut services to more than 2,500 Starlink Kits located at notorious scam centres in Myanmar. This follows heightened scrutiny: on 14 October, the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee reportedly opened an investigation into Starlink’s connections to those centres and sought testimony from Elon Musk. Around 16 October, some areas of Myanmar near the Thailand border experienced Starlink outages. Starlink — though not officially licensed in Myanmar — is widely used there (over 3,000 dishes in use) to bypass junta internet controls established after the 2021 coup. Anti-junta forces, humanitarian actors, journalists, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), and local communities rely on the service for communications, reporting human rights abuses, education, money transfers, and emergency medical help. Cutting services to devices linked to illicit activity addresses legitimate concerns about online crime, but broad or imprecise restrictions risk severing critical lifelines for pro-democracy groups, aid organisations, and vulnerable civilians in areas already subject to repeated internet blackouts and surveillance. The event thus raises immediate questions about targeting illicit actors without undermining humanitarian, educational, and civil society communications.

"Hong Kong Public Broadcaster RTHK Orders University libraries to Remove All RTHK-related Archived Content","Event Summary
On 10 October 2025, Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) ordered university libraries to remove all RTHK television programs from their collections by November 5, 2025, affecting physical formats (VCDs, DVDs) and digital platforms. Education University issued a &#8220;Program Removal Notice&#8221; to staff and students announcing the mandatory removal deadline. At Baptist University, the few remaining searchable RTHK programs are now inaccessible, while Hong Kong University&#8217;s digital archive of media content, which included RTHK programs like &#8220;Hong Kong Connection,&#8221; &#8220;Headliner,&#8221; &#8220;Below the Lion Rock,&#8221; &#8220;City Forum&#8221; and others until August 2025, has completely disappeared. RTHK stated it &#8220;currently does not provide copyright exemptions to any institutions&#8221; and that its policy provides programs from the past 12 months for public viewing, without denying the removal orders. Baptist University confirmed that when &#8220;authorization agreements terminate,&#8221; materials must be removed per agreements. This follows RTHK&#8217;s recent &#8220;major purge&#8221; of its Podcast One website, where programs like &#8220;The Pulse,&#8221; &#8220;Morning Brew,&#8221; &#8221; This Week &#8221; disappeared entirely, and &#8220;Hong Kong Connection&#8221; and &#8220;Legco Review&#8221; were reduced from over 1,300 episodes dating to 2010 to fewer than 100 episodes from the past two years. RTHK also ordered YouTube to remove citizen-backed archives and announced it would no longer upload programs to YouTube or podcasts to &#8220;concentrate traffic&#8221; on official platforms and &#8220;protect copyright.&#8221; This represents expansion of censorship from RTHK&#8217;s own platforms to university library collections, eliminating academic preservation of public broadcaster content.

"Abduction of Opposition PF Acting President Signals New Peak in Political Violence, Sparks Nationwide Alarm","Event Summary
On 19 November 2025, Given Lubinda, acting president of Zambia’s opposition Patriotic Front (PF) and contender for the party presidency, was abducted in Kabwe by a group that included at least one individual wearing United Party for National Development (UPND) attire. Video footage and social media livestreams captured Lubinda being forcibly restrained and assaulted. A UPND youth cadre later admitted involvement during a live broadcast. The incident triggered nationwide alarm due to Lubinda’s high-profile status and the overtly political nature of the violence. Home Affairs Minister Jack Mwiimbu condemned the attack, pledging that all perpetrators—regardless of political affiliation—would face criminal accountability. The Catholic Bishops also condemned the abduction, urging political actors to reject hostility and uphold peace. This incident highlights escalating political tensions and the growing normalization of violence in Zambia’s political landscape. Although civil society has not yet been directly targeted, the rapid rise in politically motivated attacks in the same week is alarming and could spill over, creating a hostile environment for civic actors and democratic engagement. Continuous monitoring is critical to determine whether these patterns evolve into broader repression or intimidation of activists. Civil society should prepare proactive advocacy strategies to safeguard democratic norms and prevent further erosion of political freedoms, as these developments risk creating a chilling effect on participation and weakening the enabling environment for civic space.

"Public Consultation on Draft Electoral Decree Launched Amid Transparency Gaps and Civil Society Exclusion in Haiti","Event Summary
On October 30, 2025, Haiti&#8217;s Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) published an electoral draft decreed for public consultation and launched a Political Party Capacity Building Program. These steps are part of a planned transition to elected authorities by 7 February 2026, though the timeline remains uncertain due to gang violence, mass displacement, insecurity, constitutional crisis, and budget constraints. The draft decree marks an initial stage in the electoral process, with further steps including public input integration, final adoption, and official publication. While the text formally acknowledges civil society organizations (CSOs) as sources of proposals for polling station staff, it does not grant advisory or decision-making roles. Nor does it define accreditation, protection, or rights for election observers—limiting CSOs&#8217; ability to monitor elections, a critical function in fragile transitions. Transparency provisions are weak, with minimal requirements for publishing reports or granting access to voting data. Consultation mechanisms before and after the vote are poorly defined, and CSOs lack formal channels to challenge CEP decisions or propose amendments. They are also excluded from electoral dispute bodies, reducing their influence in resolving conflicts. This framework offers limited space for CSOs, signaling persistent structural barriers to inclusive, credible elections. While public consultation creates advocacy opportunities, the absence of robust guarantees for participation and oversight undermines trust and constrains the enabling environment for civil society. Although the decree does not yet guarantee advisory or decision-making roles for CSOs, early engagement offers a rare chance to shape rules before they are finalized.

"Two Leaders Killed in Colombia as Violence Against Social and Political Leaders Intensifies","Event Summary

On 17 November 2025, Julián Arenas, a social and political leader from the left-wing coalition Pacto Histórico, was murdered in Chaparral (Tolima), marking the 174th killing of social leaders in 2025, according to the Institute of Studies for Development and Peace (Indepaz). In a separate incident, indigenous leader José Adelmo Valencia was attacked in early days of November while returning home in rural Santander de Quilichao. Due to the severity of his injuries, he was transferred to a clinic in Cali, where he later died on the night of 17 November 2025. These killings underscore the worsening human rights crisis in Colombia, where violence against social and indigenous leaders continues to escalate. The persistent targeting of community leaders not only threatens individual lives but also undermines democratic participation and weakens the enabling environment for civil society.

"Civil Society Coalition Urges Algeria to Free All Peaceful Activists, Condemns Selective Pardons","Event Summary
On 22 November 2025, the Algeria Solidarity Group, a collective of civil society actors including the Foundation for the Promotion of Rights, issued a statement urging the immediate and unconditional release of all individuals imprisoned for peacefully expressing their political views and conscience in Algeria. The appeal followed the presidential pardon of writer Boualem Sansal , which the group criticized as selective, noting that many others remain behind bars for social media posts, writings, union activities, and non-violent political engagement. The statement reaffirmed that freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly are guaranteed by Algeria&#8217;s Constitution and international obligations, and condemned the use of prolonged pre-trial detention, unfounded prosecutions, and restrictive laws to silence dissent. It warned that trust between citizens and institutions cannot be restored while imprisonment persists as a response to legitimate ideas, signaling a deeply constrained environment for civil society advocacy and participation.

"Protests and tensions surrounding the ‘Generation Z’ movement","Event Summary
In 2025, mobilizations led by Generation Z emerged in Nepal, characterized by digitally driven organization and the use of popular cultural symbols. The protest began after the government restricted access to digital platforms. This discontent escalated quickly and, amid demonstrations and repression, the movement succeeded in pressuring the prime minister to resign and restoring access to the digital platforms.
This movement became global, and Mexico was no exception. Toward the end of October, calls attributed to “Generation Z” began circulating on social media, urging nationwide demonstrations on November 15, using the same iconography popularized in Nepal. However, some sectors—such as government supporters—pointed to signs of possible political instrumentalization by opposition parties. Meanwhile, other Generation Z collectives expressed distrust toward the November 15 call to protest, arguing that the movement was being guided by anti-rights and conservative groups.
For its part, the federal government, during the morning press conference, displayed the accounts of those calling for the November 15 march and their alleged ties to the opposition. The main concern was the public exposure of these individuals’ personal data.
At the end of the November 15 march in Mexico City, clashes were reported that left roughly one hundred people injured by the police, as well as 20 participants detained. The city government has opened investigation files due to the possible use of excessive force.
This event represents a situation that requires close monitoring due to the associated sociopolitical risks. Youth movements with legitimate demands can be co-opted by different political factions and anti-rights groups, leading to greater polarization and institutional tension. There is also an ongoing risk of disinformation, including AI-generated videos of “parents demanding justice” for detentions that never occurred. This has also been reflected internationally, where Donald Trump’s government has claimed that such events constitute grounds for intervention in the country.

"Violent attack on Baul supporters after arrest of artist Abul Sarkar in Manikganj","Event Summary
On 20 November 2025, Baul singer Abul Sarkar was arrested on allegations of hurting religious sentiment during a pala gaan performance on 4 November at the Khala Pagli fair in Jabra, Ghior. Following his arrest, supporters announced a peaceful human chain demanding his unconditional release. Around 10:30 am on 23 November, during this peaceful rally near the Shaheed Miraj–Tapan Stadium in Manikganj, counter-protesters identifying themselves as Tawhidi Janata launched a violent attack.
At least three artists were injured, sustaining head and body injuries requiring stitches. Video footage shows Baul followers fleeing into a pond to escape beatings as attackers chanted threat-intensifying slogans targeting Baul followers. Police officers present appeared reluctant to intervene until after the violence escalated. One of the injured followers later filed a case at Manikganj Sadar Police Station, naming unknown assailants.
The incident reflects a wider surge of hostility against Bauls, fakirs, and shrine-goers across Bangladesh. Over the past year and a half, the country has witnessed numerous assaults on shrines, including arson, vandalism, exhumation of bodies, forced cutting of Bauls’ hair, closure of musical gatherings, and harassment of devotees.
Civil society, rights defenders, and cultural organisations have strongly criticised the arrest and the subsequent violence. Transparency International Bangladesh publicly condemned the arrest and warned of the growing threat of extremism to artistic freedom and civic space. Multiple CSOs and cultural bodies described the attack as part of a broader erosion of cultural pluralism.
The rapid detention of Abul Sarkar for expressing himself during an artistic event -contrasted with continued failure to investigate and prosecute cases of violence against religious minorities-illustrates selective enforcement and rising impunity, deepening risks for cultural expression, community safety, and Bangladesh’s syncretic heritage.

"Intimidation of Congolese human rights defenders and loss of lives linked to Operation Zero Kuluna","Event Summary
Between 17 and 25 October 2025, two leading civil society figures in the Republic of Congo – the executive director of the Congolese Human Rights Observatory (OCDH) and the director of the Centre for Development Action (CAD) – were the targets of an escalating campaign of intimidation on social media. This campaign took place as they denounced human rights violations committed as part of Operation Zero Kuluna, carried out by the Directorate General of Presidential Security (DGSP) to combat armed youth gangs known as ‘Bébés noirs’ (Black Babies).

On 17 October, a pro-government commentator posted a threatening message on Facebook attacking the director of the OCDH after she called for an end to extrajudicial executions in the context of Operation Zero Kuluna.
On 25 October, another Facebook user falsely accused the director of CAD of being a Black Babies gang leader and circulated his photo, presenting him as actively wanted by the security services.

Also on 25 October, Bongho Andayi Lemy, an ordinary citizen with no militant or criminal ties, was summarily executed by DGSP agents during the operation. His body, bearing gunshot wounds, was anonymously deposited at the Brazzaville municipal morgue, a practice that morgue staff describe as commonplace in DGSP operations. DGSP emissaries subsequently acknowledged their responsibility unofficially and offered to cover funeral expenses, while refusing to identify the perpetrators.
These incidents are part of a broader wave of harassment unleashed by the DGSP. Any individual or organisation that raises human rights concerns is quickly labelled a gang sympathiser and subjected to hate speech. Influencers close to the authorities, such as members of the Presidential Youth Movement, have actively mobilised social media to discredit civil society and justify abuses, thereby reinforcing an ecosystem of intimidation that is not necessarily organised but clearly pro-government.
State authorities have not condemned the threats or abuses; on the contrary, the Minister of Communication has publicly criticised NGOs for opposing the operation. The intensity of this harassment campaign has prompted Congolese activists to respond on social media in order to reframe the issue and clarify the motivations behind civil society&#8217;s positions on this operation. In response, the OCDH published a position paper on 3 November denouncing the intimidation of human rights defenders. On the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, RPDH published a statement calling on the government to strengthen the protection of women defenders who are subject to attacks and digital harassment. The organisation recommended the urgent adoption of the law on the protection of defenders.

"Journalist Saâd Bouakba Jailed Over Alleged Attack on Algeria’s Revolutionary Symbols","Event Summary


On 27 November 2025, veteran Algerian journalist and writer Saâd Bouakba was placed in pre-trial detention by the Bir Mourad Raïs court in Algiers. The case stems from a complaint filed by Mahdia Ben Bella, daughter of Algeria’s first president, accusing Bouakba of “attacking the memory of her father and the historical symbols of the Algerian state.” The allegations relate to a program aired on Vision TV News’ YouTube channel titled “This is how the leaders of the revolution divided the funds of the FLN: shocking historical revelations,” in which Bouakba claimed that revolutionary leaders misappropriated FLN funds for personal use. Prosecutors charged Bouakba and the channel’s owner under articles 148 bis 1, 333 bis 6 and 196 bis of the Penal Code covering insult, defamation via ICT, and dissemination of false news. The case has been referred for immediate appearance, with a hearing scheduled for 4 December 2025.




This arrest is viewed as part of a growing trend of judicial harassment against independent voices. Prosecuting historical commentary under defamation laws undermines freedom of expression and investigative journalism. This incident further erodes the enabling environment for civil society in Algeria, fostering self-censorship and discouraging public debate on governance and historical accountability. Such measures contravene Algeria’s obligations under international law, including Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which guarantees the right to freedom of expression, and the UN Human Rights Committee’s General Comment No. 34, which emphasizes that restrictions on speech must be necessary, proportionate, and not used to stifle criticism of public figures or historical debate.

"Congressman calls for sanctions against two non-governmental organisations for commenting on the continued tenure of the interim Attorney General","Event Summary
On 12 November 2025,  a congressman requested that the executive director of the Peruvian Agency for International Cooperation (APCI) evaluate initiating disciplinary proceedings against non-governmental organisations Legal Defense Institute (IDL) and the National Human Rights Coordinator (CNDDHH). Both organisations had submitted a request to the Board of Supreme Prosecutors of the Public Ministry to elect a new Attorney General, arguing that the appointment of interim Attorney General was invalid.
According to the congressman, both organisations allegedly committed very serious infractions by supposedly using resources from international technical cooperation for purposes unrelated to the objectives that justify their funding. He argued that under the current amendment to the APCI Law (Article 21), this would constitute “misuse,” as these funds were allegedly used against the Peruvian State.
Both IDL and CNDDHH rejected this request and warned that the APCI Law was being used to silence critical voices and restrict the work of organisations amid investigations into alleged acts of corruption. The CNDDHH stated that “these types of actions seek to delegitimise and distort the role of civil society organisations in a democratic system by associating their oversight work with the misuse of international resources under the APCI Law.”
These measures could infringe upon the rights to freedom of expression and participation in public affairs by attempting to restrict their ability to publish statements or petitions, or to take a position on matters that could be considered unconstitutional, such as the appointment of questionable authorities or the approval of regulations that violate fundamental rights.

"Historic Step for Civic Engagement: Colombia Publishes Decree 1229 increasing Citizen Participation in National Planning","Event Summary
On 27 November 2025, Colombia’s National Planning Department (DNP) issued Decree 1229 of 2025, establishing a regulatory framework for the National Planning System (SNP) and institutionalizing participatory planning mechanisms. For the first time, public investment projects must include citizen participation with differential, ethnic, gender, territorial, and life-cycle approaches, marking a significant advance toward inclusive governance.
The decree responds to long-standing civil society demands and years of dialogue, aiming to strengthen transparency and accountability in public investment decisions. The reform emerges as a milestone for participatory democracy, though its success will depend on effective implementation and adequate resources.
This development positively impacts the enabling environment for civil society by expanding formal spaces for engagement and recognizing diversity in decision-making. It aligns with Article 25 of the ICCPR, which guarantees citizens’ right to participate in public affairs, and supports SDG 16 on promoting peaceful, inclusive societies and accountable institutions.

"Targeted Murders of Indigenous Leaders in Buenaventura and La Plata","Event Summary
November 2025 witnessed a surge in targeted killings of social and indigenous leaders in Colombia by armed groups, deepening fears for minority rights and civic space. On 27 November 2025, Niver Membache Piraza, an indigenous leader of the Wounaan-Khirardú people, was murdered in Buenaventura while with his family. Just two days earlier, on 25 November, Eduardo Campo, an indigenous guard and community representative of the Nasa peoples, was killed after being intercepted on a road in La Plata (Huila)/Cauca. Both were targeted for their roles defending indigenous rights, adding to the growing number of social leaders killed in 2025.
These attacks create an atmosphere of fear, weaken indigenous governance structures, and severely undermine the enabling environment for civil society, particularly for minority groups. Constitutional guarantees and international obligations under ICCPR Articles 6 and 25 and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples are being undermined, signaling a serious deterioration in the enabling environment for civil society, eroding trust in state protection and deepening fear among minority groups.
